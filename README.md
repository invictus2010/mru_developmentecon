# Marginal Revolution Development Economics

Marginal Revolution University (MRU) provides online courses in economics. They host their videos on YouTube, which allows us to pull their transcripts. 

This project explores the value of GPT and embeddings in summarizing and cataloging knowledge from an online course such as MRU's [Development Economics Course](https://mru.org/development-economics). We will see what value, if any, GPT yields in helping us pass an online exam.
