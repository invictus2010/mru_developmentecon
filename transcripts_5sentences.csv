Development Economics Introduction,"Here's an overview of our course  on development economics. First thing to notice  that this is a full course in development economics. If you work your way through all of the material, you will have a very good background in all of the major issues and ideas of the field. Also, we've made the course non-technical but on the cutting edge; we cover a lot of recent papers  in development economics. This means that the course will be accessible to beginners but also we will have lots of materials of interest to the specialist.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYl_tYUduT4
Development Economics Introduction,"You can work your way  through the material like a course; we're very happy about that; but you can also pick and choose  what's of most interest to you, Ã  la Khan Academy. As I'll talk about it in a minute, we do have a final exam, if you work your way through it as a course. There are two optional sections on India and on people in development economics, and again, feel free to browse those as your interest takes you. We begin in the course with some basic facts of development economics. We look at some of the most fundamental causes of the wealth of nations such as geography.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYl_tYUduT4
Development Economics Introduction,"We look at some of the workhorse models in the field such as the Solow model of economic growth, the O-ring model, big push models. We look at some key sectors: water, food, education. Some key institutions:  property rights, corruption, finance. In terms of evaluation,  there are end of video quizzes which are usually fairly easy. Just to give you an idea whether  you were listening or not, there's a midterm with  some essay-type questions that's entirely optional, it's not graded.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYl_tYUduT4
Development Economics Introduction,"Then there's a final exam with a certificate. If you do well on the final exam, you get the certificate. Finally, we want you to share this material, so we are very happy if you are teaching development economics and you'd like to point your students to one of our lectures. Great! Feel free to do that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYl_tYUduT4
Development Economics Introduction,"Put the material on your blog, of course,  point them to mruniversity.com, but feel free to share this material. We want it to be used  as widely as possible. Also, we'd love to have you contribute. We've already received a number of excellent contributions on issues in development economics. You can do things like suggest more end of video questions  and answers for the quizzers.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYl_tYUduT4
Development Economics Introduction,"You can suggest papers to read, you can upload even your own videos. We're very happy about this. So, that's it, development economics, we hope you enjoy the course. Thanks.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYl_tYUduT4
Basic Facts of Growth and Development,"Hi. Today, we're going to begin with some of the basic facts about growth and development. The most basic fact of all is that there are rich countries and there are poor countries, and the differences  between them are extreme. So, the United States, it's not the world's richest economy  in terms of GDP per capita, but it's the world's  richest large economy. And we see the GDP per capita in the United States is about $47,000 per year.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fJZlPzDMvc
Basic Facts of Growth and Development,"Now, over here, in the poorest ten countries in the world; the very poorest, Congo and Burundi, competing for the bottom spot. What we see here is that GDP per capita in these countries, it's not ten times lower, -- it's not even a hundred times lower, it's a little bit more than a hundred times lower  than in the United States, about a hundred times lower than in some of the European economies. So, the differences in GDP per capita are extreme. Now, these differences  in GDP per capita, as much as possible, we have tried to correct for differences in prices and so forth, to make these comparable figures. So, these are what we call PPP adjusted figures, and for more on that adjustment, which is not always perfect, but as close as we can get, -- do check out our video  on purchasing power parity.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fJZlPzDMvc
Basic Facts of Growth and Development,"Another thing to notice is that most of the poorest  countries in the world, not all of them, but most of the poorest countries in the world are in Africa. Timor-Leste used to be part of Indonesia and, of course, there are other poor countries in the world. But the very poorest countries tend to cluster in Africa. Now, why is the United States so much richer than these other countries? Well, the most basic reason is that the United States has grown consistently for a very  long period of time.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fJZlPzDMvc
Basic Facts of Growth and Development,"So, what this graph shows, is GDP per capita, real GDP per capita,  over the last 210 years, from 1800 to 2010. Now, this graph. We've graphed it in an interesting way. Notice here, on the vertical axis, we have doublings. So, this is called a ratio scale.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fJZlPzDMvc
Basic Facts of Growth and Development,"So, from 1000 to 2000 is a doubling. >From 2000 to 4000  is a doubling. >From 4000 to 800  is a doubling, and so forth. One of the reasons we have done that, is that it makes it easier  to compare growth rates. What this means is that a straight line on this graph is a line of constant growth.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fJZlPzDMvc
Basic Facts of Growth and Development,"In fact, we can do  a little bit better than that. Let's look at a doubling time. So, GDP per capita in the United States hit about $2,000 somewhere  around 1840-1845. It doubled to 4000 by 1880. So that's a difference, a doubling time of 35 years.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fJZlPzDMvc
Basic Facts of Growth and Development,"Well, we know immediately, from the rule of 70, that means that real GDP per capita  in the United States, over this time span,  was about 2% per year. Now, if that seems a little bit confusing to you, you're not sure where I got that number, do check out our video, The Rule of 70. What we can also see, is that growth rate in the United States has been about 2% per year for about 200 years with some obvious exceptions. This here is the Great Depression for example. Really marked even larger  than the Great Recession which we've had more recently, much larger than that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fJZlPzDMvc
Basic Facts of Growth and Development,"Okay. What else can we do with this graph? Well, we can also use this graph to get kind of another intuitive sense of the differences in wealth or  in GDP per capita between different countries. Let's take a look at that. So, now, I've superimposed here the GDP per capita in some other countries in 2010.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fJZlPzDMvc
Basic Facts of Growth and Development,"So, what we see down here is Bangladesh, Uganda, Malawi. And Bangladesh and Uganda  are about as rich today as the United States was in 1800. Malawi is actually a little bit poorer. Again, these comparisons are not perfect, because we're making them  over very long time periods. Nevertheless, this gives us an intuitive sense of how people in other countries are living.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fJZlPzDMvc
Basic Facts of Growth and Development,"Here is Nigeria. About as rich as the typical person in the United States was in 1850. India, per capita income, about that of the United States in 1870. China has a GDP per capita -- about the same as in  the United States did in 1920. Peru, a GDP per capita,  about the US levels of 1940.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fJZlPzDMvc
Basic Facts of Growth and Development,"Here's Mexico and Argentina today, about as rich as the United States was in 1960. Italy, about where the United States was in 1980. I remember 1980, it was pretty good. So, life in Italy is not so bad at all. Here's another picture taken from my textbook with Tyler, Modern Principles, -- illustrating that the differences  in wealth between countries is something of fairly recent origin.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fJZlPzDMvc
Basic Facts of Growth and Development,"So, if you go back to  the time of Christ, year 1, or you go back to year 1000, or even to year 1500. There's not very, many differences in GDP per capita between different regions of the world. Beginning, however, perhaps with the Industrial Revolution, and picking up in the 1870s and 1800's, what we begin to see is divergence. Divergence big time in the words  of a famous paper by Lant Pritchett. So, you begin to see some countries get on this growth path like the United States, a little bit less Western Europe, and they just take off beyond anything that anyone  has ever seen before in the world.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fJZlPzDMvc
Basic Facts of Growth and Development,"This is where we get  the big differences in wealth. You could also see in this graph that, perhaps, in the last few decades, that China and some of the other countries in Asia, particularly India, are maybe  beginning to catch up. So, there's, in principle it seems, no reason why there ought to be  such big differences in wealth. It's merely that some countries got started on this growth path before the other countries did, but, now, these other countries may begin to catch up. In fact, we can see that in this graph, also taken from the Modern Principles, that there are growth miracles and growth disasters.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fJZlPzDMvc
Basic Facts of Growth and Development,"So, let's talk about  growth miracles first. One of the very first was Japan. So, here's Japan in the time  after World War II. Japan is one of the poorest  countries in the world. Very, very poor country, not much richer than Nigeria.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fJZlPzDMvc
Basic Facts of Growth and Development,"But, certainly far less rich than the United States, a very poor country. But, in the 1950s-1960s, -- it has a tremendous catch-up period, until by the 1970s and 1980s. This is growing as fast  as the United States is, and has caught up a tremendous amount to the United States. We see the same thing  happening in South Korea, again, after the Korean War. A terribly poor, impoverished country, maybe even a little bit  poorer than Nigeria.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fJZlPzDMvc
Basic Facts of Growth and Development,"And, yet, we see the beginning,  again, in the 1960s and 1970s tremendous growth, catching up. These are what we call growth miracles. So, this tells us that, -- with the right institutions, with the right factors in place, a country which is behind the frontier can catch up much, much  more quickly to US levels of growth. So, it took the United States  200 years to get to where the US rate of GDP per capita is today. But, other countries seem  to be able to do this, at least to catch up within 40 years.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fJZlPzDMvc
Basic Facts of Growth and Development,"The catch-up phase is about a generation. We also see in this picture  that there are growth disasters. There's nothing automatic about growth. So, in terms of GDP per capita, Nigeria has not grown in 50 years. Some ups and downs, often due to the price of oil, but basically has not grown at all.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fJZlPzDMvc
Basic Facts of Growth and Development,"We also see Argentina. Argentina used to be, in the 19th century, one of the richest countries in the world, close to that of the United States. And, yet, it has failed to grow; even in this period, -- it had a declining growth rate. So that, today, Argentina is poorer than South Korea, and poorer than Japan, even though, for much of  its history, Argentina was richer. So, it is possible, if you don't install the right policies, for a country to fail to grow.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fJZlPzDMvc
Basic Facts of Growth and Development,"Now, why do we care so much about GDP per capita? Well, first, by definition, this means more goods, and that tends to be a good thing. So, more automobiles,  bigger and better houses, more computers, -- more books; more ice cream. These are all good things, especially the ice cream. In addition, however, GDP per capita tends to correlate with  a whole variety of desirable attributes.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fJZlPzDMvc
Basic Facts of Growth and Development,"Things like more leisure, more time to do yoga, more time to devote to charity and family, and so forth. It's also more fun to live in a society with greater GDP per capita. Also, we tend to have more democracy. There tends to be greater rights for women in societies with  higher GDP per capita. And life expectancy tends to be a lot higher in societies with higher  GDP per capita.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fJZlPzDMvc
Basic Facts of Growth and Development,"And that's what I want to look at now, life expectancy. I'm going to do so,  using this video from Gapminder. By the way, go check out Gapminder, lots of interesting data, lots of fun videos and  things that you can create. Okay. Let's take a look.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fJZlPzDMvc
Basic Facts of Growth and Development,"What we see in this video is income per person on the horizontal axis, that's our GDP per capita, that's in PPP adjusted terms, and life expectancy on the vertical axis. Now, in 1800, life expectancy everywhere  in the world was less than 40 years. It was 40 years in the world's richest economy, at the time in the United Kingdom. Everywhere else, less than that. This is not because  everyone is dying at age 45, it's primarily because you had lots  of people dying at very young ages, between the ages of 0 and age 5 or so.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fJZlPzDMvc
Basic Facts of Growth and Development,"Okay. Let's get this video going and  see what happens over time. By the way, the big red dot, that's China. The big blue dot, that's India. These dots are proportional to population.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fJZlPzDMvc
Basic Facts of Growth and Development,"Let's get the video going. We can see that, over time, countries are slowly increasing in GDP per capita. Notice that the ups and downs, those are often wars, times of real distress. So, here, we have things are  beginning to improve in the 1870s. World War I is coming.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fJZlPzDMvc
Basic Facts of Growth and Development,"Watch out for World War I and influenza. Big drop there. Comes right there  in the Western economies. Here comes World War II, we're gonna see a big drop. Here comes the 1950s in China.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fJZlPzDMvc
Basic Facts of Growth and Development,"Take a look at China! Great leap forward. That was a great leap downward in life expectancy because  of mass starvation. Alright. Here, we come  to the modern world.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fJZlPzDMvc
Basic Facts of Growth and Development,"Once again, we see there's a positive relationship between income per person  and life expectancy. We also see that the very poorest countries in the world basically have not grown at all, but their life expectancy is much higher. So, these very poor countries, they have managed to get some gains  from growth elsewhere in the world, primarily in things  like vaccines and vitamins, and other factors which  increase life expectancy. So, life expectancy is higher even though these countries, in fact, are not that much richer. What else do we see?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fJZlPzDMvc
Basic Facts of Growth and Development,"Well, we can see that  life expectancy increases, as I mentioned, in GDP per capita, but also that, within a constant  level of GDP per capita, life expectancy can differ. So, here's India, here's Vietnam; that's a higher life expectancy. There's Sudan. A lower life expectancy despite the same GDP per capita. So, countries can devote more or fewer resources to things like health care,  to things like education, and to other factors  which increase GDP per capita.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fJZlPzDMvc
Basic Facts of Growth and Development,"Okay. So, those are some of the very  basic factors about economic growth. And one of the reasons  we're interested in economic growth, is it's positively correlated  with life expectancy, with fun, with leisure, with a whole bunch of good things. Okay. Thanks.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fJZlPzDMvc
The Importance of Institutions (Brief),"Today, we're going to take a brief look at the importance of institutions. This will be brief in that  we're not going to look today -- at which institution are important, and we're not going to try and explain the mechanisms by which institutions work. Instead, what we want to do is offer the big picture: Why do people study institutions? Why do people think that institutions  are important for economic growth? Let's take a look.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqQDhqFygAc
The Importance of Institutions (Brief),"North and South Korea provide  almost a perfect natural experiment demonstrating the power of institutions. In 1944, North Korea and  South Korea were very similar. They had the same people,  the same culture, the same language, the same history, -- very similar economies. If anything, North Korea was  a little bit more industrialized, South Korea, a little bit more agrarian. Then, in 1945, the country was split -- and North Korea chose communism, -- a totalitarian state, centrally planned, centrally directed; no private property rights, very little room for private initiative, no free press.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqQDhqFygAc
The Importance of Institutions (Brief),"South Korea, broadly speaking, chose capitalism. Private property rights, a free economy, much bigger scope of private initiative, a free press; not always honored, of course. But, broadly speaking,  South Korea chose capitalism, North Korea chose communism. Now, what were the results of these choices? 50 years later, the results are so clear, an alien could see them from outer space.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqQDhqFygAc
The Importance of Institutions (Brief),"That this is a picture of North and  South Korea, taken from outer space. And what you see is  South Korea has lights, broad lights, people going out to parties, lighting up their home. What you see in South Korea  is a developed modern economy. Up here, in North Korea, what you see is darkness, with the one exception of Pyongyang, -- the central city where  the ruling elite lives. Massive differences  created in just 50 years.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqQDhqFygAc
The Importance of Institutions (Brief),"Today, South Korea has a GDP per capita at least 10 times, probably 15 times higher  than that in North Korea. South Korea is a modern developed economy, the most wired economy in the world, the standard of living, equal to  that of most western countries. North Korea is in periodic starvation, a militarized state where  the people are regularly starving. That is the difference which  institutions can make in just a matter of a few generations. Here's another picture which could  suggest the power of institutions.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqQDhqFygAc
The Importance of Institutions (Brief),"This is Nogales. On the right is Nogales, Mexico. On the left is Nogales, Arizona Now, there's a lot here which is the same. Clearly, for example,  the geography is the same. You might think the people are different, but, actually, the people and the culture are also very similar.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqQDhqFygAc
The Importance of Institutions (Brief),"So, until the 1850s, both parts  of Nogales were parts of Mexico. So, many of the people share,  on both sides of this fence, the same ancestors. They have a very similar culture. So, what differs? In Nogales, Arizona, -- income is about three times higher than in Nogales, Mexico, which is actually one of the richer parts of Mexico.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqQDhqFygAc
The Importance of Institutions (Brief),"Life expectancy is higher on the left. The infrastructure, the roads,  the other public infrastructure, the hospitals and so forth,  is better in the United States. It's easier to open a business in Nogales, Arizona than in Nogales, Mexico. Democracy is more reliable on the left  of this picture than it is on the right. Crime is lower on the left  than it is on the right.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqQDhqFygAc
The Importance of Institutions (Brief),"Well, why? The difference here,  again, is institutions. Institutions make the difference. These two examples, I think,  are good illustrations of the fact that institutions matter. But we haven't said  which institutions matter and why do they matter.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqQDhqFygAc
The Importance of Institutions (Brief),"In future lectures,  we'll be talking more about some of the possibilities,  about institutions like property rights, the rule of laws, free press, honest government, open markets. We'll also be talking about  facts which may underlie something such as  honest government, like trust. And then we'll be asking not only  what are the effects of institutions, but what are the causes of institutions? Why is it that some countries have different institutions than others? Is this due to accidents of history?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqQDhqFygAc
The Importance of Institutions (Brief),"Is this due to differences in  geography or in culture? All of these questions are really important, and we'll be dealing with  them more as we go on. Thanks.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqQDhqFygAc
"Guns, Germs and Steel","Hello everyone, this is Development  Economics by Tyler Cowen and Alex Tobruk I'm Alex Tobruk, today we're going to be talking about guns, Guns, Germs, and Steel which is Jared Diamond's really big  think book key book everyone should read about the really big questions about  development. Diamond is asking, you know why are some regions and countries  rich while others are poor, and in particular he's asking why is it that  Eurasia developed first, rather than South America, Africa, or Australia very  exciting opening of Guns, Germs, and Steel has Pizarro, you know, with the hundred  soldiers, sixty horses, and some steel and guns, of course taken over the entire  Incan Empire with 80,000 soldiers. How is this possible, why did this happen? Well  very briefly Diamond argues that there are surprisingly few domesticable animals  and crops and regions of the world which had these animals and crops which were  capable of being domesticated. This led to agriculture, which led to cities, and  civilization, that led to guns and to steel, and agriculture and domesticated  animals also led to an even more potent weapon than guns, the most destructive  weapon ever used on earth: germs.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GshzzmJBGM
"Guns, Germs and Steel","So let's take a look in a little bit more detail  about argument. First of all why are domesticable animals important? Well  they're so important because all their many uses so a domesticated  animal, like a cow, can be used for milk, for meat, for clothing, for leather, and so forth. Can also be used to plow, as a source of power, a source  of power allowing humans to do what they otherwise could not. Could even be used  as a military vehicle to help take over and protect and defend.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GshzzmJBGM
"Guns, Germs and Steel","Now these domesticated domesticable animals were not evenly distributed  across the globe. In fact there are surprisingly few of them in the world  today there's really only five major cases sheep, goats, cows, pigs, and horses there's a few lesser cases the Arabian camel, the bactrian camel, donkeys, and  reindeers, llamas, and alpacas, Mithan, which I had never even heard of before I'd read Diamond and maybe a few others, the Yak. Well the wild ancestors of these  animals were not spread evenly across the globe. None of the ancestors was indigenous to  sub-saharan Africa. Only the llama and the alpaca had a wild ancestor which was  indigenous to South or North America.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GshzzmJBGM
"Guns, Germs and Steel","13 of the 14 were indigenous to Eurasia so  Eurasia began with a major element in its favor. It had these animals, these  wild ancestors of animals which could and which did later become domesticated. Without having these domesticated domesticable animals it's much harder  to develop mass agriculture. Think about growing rice without plow, and from there  it's much harder to get cities, of course, and civilizations. By the way, this is a  picture I took in a Peruvian Museum I believe it shows how you're supposed  to ride a llama, you can see where llamas are not as good as alpacas, allotted not  as good as horses there may be other some other interpretations of what's  going on here but that at least was my interpretation.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GshzzmJBGM
"Guns, Germs and Steel","Now this raises a  question of course. Diamond shows that the wild ancestors of the animals which  are currently domesticated they're almost all native to Eurasia now  his argument is that these animals were basically the only ones which were  capable of being domesticated. How does he get there? How does he show that these are the only ones which were capable of being domesticated? Well he's got a  bunch of varied arguments for this none of them are sort of drop-dead  definitive but I do think in total they're quite, they're quite convincing  more than one might expect.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GshzzmJBGM
"Guns, Germs and Steel","First of all, the domesticated animals have been  domesticated on several different occasions independently. So it seems like  there is a demand for domestication and if the supply is there it's going to  happen it's happened several times several times independently so it seems  that there's forces pushing towards domestication if  it's possible. Also we know that when these animals are induced, introduced to  non-indigenous areas the natives figure out hey this is great we need to use  these this is a good idea so think about the Native Americans and that you know  wild that horse culture you know the Apaches and the horse culture. Of course,  horses didn't even come to North America, South America, until the 1500s. Before  that they were unknown, but once the natives saw horses they knew this was a  good thing, suggesting once again, that if it had been possible for them to  domesticate some of their own indigenous species that they would have done  so.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GshzzmJBGM
"Guns, Germs and Steel","There's also many animals are excluded from domestication by a variety of their  characteristics. So some of them are just too fierce. Grizzly bears, African Buffalo is really hard to domesticate. How come you've never seen a zebra rodeo? Well zebras are just mean beasts, they're just very difficult to ride don't try  and ride a zebra that's why we don't see them.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GshzzmJBGM
"Guns, Germs and Steel","Then there's the diet issue some the diet is too limited, like the koalas just eating the eucalyptus, others their diet  to growth ratio is not fast enough to make domestication worthwhile. So  you don't want to really domesticate a carnivore, you've got to grow an animal  to eat other animals, it's it's really not gonna work, you want to have an  animal which eats grasses and grains and so forth and grows really big on that. Then there's animals which are difficult to herd the you've heard how difficult  it is to herd cats well there you go so cats have sort of been domesticated some  people think that cats have domesticated people rather than the other way around  but certainly you don't get a group of them together. Antelopes and so forth  are hard to herd. Finally there's some animals which actually don't like to  have sex when people are watching.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GshzzmJBGM
"Guns, Germs and Steel","Pandas are like this, they're a little  bit embarrassed, this is why the Washington zoo has spent millions of  dollars trying to get their pandas to have sex even showing them panda porn but not  much seems to. So what about crops? So the case for crops is similar to that of  animals Diamond argues that the domesticable crops again were central to  Eurasia, were not found elsewhere. A little bit harder to make here, because  there are more animals which were more crops, which were capable of being  domesticated than there are animals. There's probably several thousand plants  which are capable of being domesticated.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GshzzmJBGM
"Guns, Germs and Steel","Nevertheless, the basic facts are  really rather striking. Even today, two cereals, wheat and rice account for 41%  of all total calories consumed in the world, suggesting that if you didn't have  wheat and you didn't have rice these crops, which were so important to human  civilization, probably you're not going to get civilization either or  certainly you're going to get it more difficultly, or slower. Wheat is native  to just the Fertile Crescent around modern Turkey and Iraq. Rice of course  from... from China. The other major cereals in addition to wheat and rice, we have a corn barley and sorghum.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GshzzmJBGM
"Guns, Germs and Steel","Four or five of these are from  Eurasia. Sorghum is from North Africa, which is clearly more, really part of  Eurasia rather than Africa, it's probably easier to get there because of the  Sahara. The indigenous versions of wheat, rice, and barley, and sorghum are very  similar to the domesticated versions. Corn from Mesoamerica and its wild  version is very different. Those baby corns which you can buy in the store in  a can, that's actually closer to what wild corn, you know, once looked like.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GshzzmJBGM
"Guns, Germs and Steel","So  it took a lot longer to domesticate corn than it did to domesticate wheat, rice,  barley, or sorghum. It also turns out that a lot of plants are surprisingly  difficult to domesticate. You know for example, just to give one example, we  think we know how to grow apples because of Johnny Appleseed, and you know,  throwing the seeds, but we're wrong. That's not how you grow apples. Apples  grown from seeds actually don't taste very good.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GshzzmJBGM
"Guns, Germs and Steel","Plants don't grow that  well, the way to get delicious apples is grafting, not seeding, not at all obvious  not at all obvious. So a lot of plants are more difficult to domesticate than  you might imagine. Put all this together, we have an uneven  distribution of these domesticable plants and animals led some parts of the  world, Eurasia in particular to develop develop agriculture. Agriculture and  other ideas in Eurasia also spread faster because the major axis of the  continent is East-West rather than North-South. This meant that since  climate is similar along lines of latitude along these East-West lines of  latitude that a good idea developed in one part of the world could transmit  horizontally, as it were, to a large area.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GshzzmJBGM
"Guns, Germs and Steel","So this meant  that scale was actually bigger. While in Africa the North-South, you know you can  go several hundred miles north or several hundred miles south and your  crops and animals will simply not do as well in that different climate. So  Eurasia, in a sense, had a larger market. We're going to talk a lot more about  scale elsewhere in the class but even at the very beginnings of modern of  civilization we have the importance of scale having a lot of people working on  the same problem, being able to transmit their ideas all over the world to a  large area so this just this even the placement of the axes of the continents, Diamond argues, has implications. All right, well even with all of these  advantages, of guns, steel, and horses the conquest of North and South America  might have been a close call had it not been for germs.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GshzzmJBGM
"Guns, Germs and Steel","The major infectious  diseases in humans all evolved from diseases of animals. Smallpox, flu,  tuberculosis, malaria, plague and so forth they all come from animals. And Europeans  you know they live next door often in the same barn as the animals  this meant on the negative side they were repeatedly decimated by these  plagues but for that very same reason Europeans developed some immunity  so this is Darwinism in action. The humans would survived these repeated  attacks by these germs. They grew stronger and they developed some  immunity.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GshzzmJBGM
"Guns, Germs and Steel","On the other hand, in 1520 it took just one sick person to bring  smallpox to South America, where it may have killed 90%. 90% of the population. It's possible. This is a young girl with in Bangladesh. She was infected with  smallpox in 1973.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GshzzmJBGM
"Guns, Germs and Steel","You can see what an absolutely devastating, debilitating,  horrible disease it is. 1977 we eliminated smallpox from the world, the  first time this has ever been done. Well in 1520 without this developed immunity, millions of South Americans, of the indigenous population were wiped out. So this explains how Pizarro, who came 1530 1535 to the Incan Empire. So the Incan Empire was in disarray, okay, millions of these people had died from the smallpox, from these plagues, which had come over, and then you have arriving on your shores these guys on horses never before seen looking like gods with their steel, their guns, bringing down death from far away and their steel armor and their steel uh, swords, so this explains why with this culture and disarray dying from these diseases, these incredibly advanced people with their technology you've never seen before.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GshzzmJBGM
"Guns, Germs and Steel","How 100 soldiers, 60 horses were able to take over the entire Incan Empire. You see, actually the same story a little bit later in North America or  very similar, so when the pilgrims come to North America they actually find empty villages prepared for them as if by Providence. In fact, the pilgrims  were quickly drawing these conclusions so John Winthrop, who is governor of  Massachusetts, he thought the plague was great, was miraculous. He said ""but for the natives in these parts God hath so pursued them as for  300 miles space, the greatest part of them are swept away by the smallpox  which still continues among them so God hath thereby cleared our title to this  place. Those who remain in these parts being in all not 50 have put themselves  under our protection"".",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GshzzmJBGM
"Guns, Germs and Steel","So God has cleared the title, God has done his is basically  a genocide according to John Winthrop and has done this on behalf of the  pilgrims. King James said the same thing, he said ""Almighty God in his great  goodness and bounty towards us is to be thanked for sending this wonderful  plague among the savages"". So let's summarize the Diamond argument, this is  from a picture in his book. So the ultimate factors at the top of the, uh,  diagram the East-West axis of Eurasia this led to the ease of species spreading many suitable wild species. You put these two things together, you got a lot of domesticated plants and animal species.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GshzzmJBGM
"Guns, Germs and Steel","These domesticated plant and animal species meant you had food surpluses, and storage so you were able to create scale, you were able to create a lot of people in dense sedentary societies, this led to, uh, specialization and this led to technology, creating things  like guns and steel and swords, creating ocean-going ships, having some wealth there having some scientists class if you like, some research and developer  class, some people who were there to think not just to produce food this led  to political organization, the ability to gather a lot of resources together. Put  all these things together you can see why the North, why the Europeans,  you know, sent out the ships rather than the other way. And of  course with them they brought these epidemic diseases, which also had  come from the domesticated plants and particularly the domesticated animals. And one of them being the horses, so you put all this together and you understand  why Pizarro was able to take over the Incan civilization and earlier  slightly earlier of Cortes had done the same thing with the Aztecs and how in  North America, again, were able to wipe out the native populations. Okay,  so Diamond gives us a really big, really important story, it really takes us up  to sort of 1500, 1600 you might say, but what then?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GshzzmJBGM
"Guns, Germs and Steel","You know France and China,  they're both in Eurasia, but today the former is rich and the latter is poor,  despite the fact that they share most of these factors that Diamond focuses on. So  1500 France and China about equal, maybe even China a little bit richer perhaps,  but since then everything has changed, and geography hasn't changed, so  geography can explain only so much. In fact, we can say a little bit more  there's been a reversal of fortune. The rich places in 1500 actually tend not to  be the rich places today. So China and India, fabulously wealthy in  some sense in 1500 or you go and you look a little bit later in Peru,  fabulously wealthy there while there's nothing but a few shacks and teepees in  North America.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GshzzmJBGM
"Guns, Germs and Steel","South America is where all the money is, okay, richest country in  South America, perhaps Haiti from Central America. Today, the one of the poorest  countries in this area. So why is this? Clearly geography can't explain why some  countries are rich today while others are poor cannot explain it on the  Eurasian continent at least. So I think we do know something about the answer  to that question.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GshzzmJBGM
"Guns, Germs and Steel","You know, rich countries have good institutions, things like  protection of private property and the rule of law, limited government, some  form of capitalism, just to say that capitalism may be necessary or some form  of it is necessary, certainly not sufficient, but of course we're going to  be talking about all of these things a lot more as the class goes on. So Diamond,  great argument, takes us to about 1500, 1600. We're gonna be dealing with a lot  of these other things later on in the course. Thank you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GshzzmJBGM
"Geography and Development, Trade","Welcome, everyone. Today we are going to begin a new unit. We are going to be talking about geography and development. And by geography, I mean the relatively immutable and constant features, things like location, topography, climate, including temperature, rainfall, soil quality, wildlife, especially parasites, and the influence of all of these  on development. This is obviously a big topic, so today we are just going to focus on geography and trade.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt9uvMzxhbE
"Geography and Development, Trade","So I want to begin by  giving two perspectives on trade. The first is the Ricardian perspective. So Ricardo said, when 2 countries specialize in their comparative advantage, that is, they specialize in producing the good, which they can produce at lowest opportunity cost, and then they trade, both nations are better off. Now, notice that innovation  is not the focus of Ricardo. So Ricardo says, ""There already are two goods, wine and cloth.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt9uvMzxhbE
"Geography and Development, Trade","We can get more of both goods if Portugal specializes in producing wine, England specializes in producing cloth, and then they trade"". So for Ricardo, trade is about improvements in static efficiency. Notice also that in Ricardo,  market size is really not a key variable. The situation is very different in Adam Smith. Adam Smith has a  completely different theory of trade.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt9uvMzxhbE
"Geography and Development, Trade","Let's take a look at that. Smith lays out his theory of trade  in a chapter in the Wealth of Nations called The division of labor is limited  by the extent of the market. And Smith makes this remarkable and very deep insight. He says, ""As by means of water-carriage,"" that is by ship and boat, ""a more extensive market is opened  to every sort of industry than what land-carriage alone  can afford it. So it is upon the sea-coast, and along the banks of navigable rivers, that industry of every kind naturally begins  to subdivide and improve"".",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt9uvMzxhbE
"Geography and Development, Trade","So what Adam Smith is saying is that when you're along in sea coast you have access to a larger market. You can sell your goods in a larger market. And because of that, -- you get economies of scale but, also, you get specialization of knowledge. You get people learning more as they produce more. This creates improvements.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt9uvMzxhbE
"Geography and Development, Trade","So for Adam Smith,  trade is a dynamic growth story. Trade, means larger markets. Larger markets means more specialization. It means more improvements in knowledge,  and therefore it means more growth. So let's take a look at  Adam Smith's theory and see if we can see it today.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt9uvMzxhbE
"Geography and Development, Trade","So what we have here is  a map of GDP density, that is, the amount of GDP  produced per square kilometer. And what you can see from this map  is that Smith was absolutely correct. So what you can see is that where GDP is, where civilization is, it's along the coast. Here's the coastal United States and, along these navigable rivers,  the Great Lakes region. You can also see Western Europe, all along the coast, all of this coastal area,  Western Europe, highly developed.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt9uvMzxhbE
"Geography and Development, Trade","Over here, Japan, and, of course, it's the coast of China which is rapidly developing all due to those export markets. Here again, the coast of Australia. Now, in fact, what you can also see is that even in places where there are great institutions, where they have  institutions of law and order, property rights, and incentives, and so forth, that we can still have low GDP  per square kilometer. So take a look at Canada. So most of Canada,  it's like the Sahara Desert, -- in terms of GDP.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt9uvMzxhbE
"Geography and Development, Trade","Canada, where Canada is developed, it's along the coast and  along navigable rivers close to the United States. Even in the United States, there are entire regions  which really are bereft of GDP which are almost as barren  as is the Sahara Desert. So if you are looking  just at institutions, you might say,  ""Well, even in the United States, where we have these great institutions, there's plenty of places  where there isn't much GDP, so it must be something else, and geography, -- particular closeness to rivers and closeness to sea coast is an important element of this. By the way, economists really  used to ignore geography. And it's due to Jeff Sachs  and some of his co-authors, particular John Gallup  and Andrew Mellinger that a lot of this work  started to be done.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt9uvMzxhbE
"Geography and Development, Trade","In addition to the article which I've noted here, -- these three authors have a review article  in Scientific American, 2001, called The Geography of Poverty and Wealth, which I recommend. Now, if being close to rivers, if being close to the sea coast  is important then what is the worst thing? Well, the worst thing that can happen is if you are landlocked. Let's take a look. So what we're showing here is GDP per capita in countries which have access to the coast over here, compared to countries  that are landlocked over here.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt9uvMzxhbE
"Geography and Development, Trade","And what you see immediately  is that countries which are landlocked have half, actually,  a little bit less than half the GDP of countries  which have access to the coast. If we look over here, at the landlocked countries, you can see there's actually a few landlocked ones in Europe: Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, of course, Switzerland. But, equally true, these countries  are actually quite close to the coast and they are close to other rich countries. If you take those countries out, the differences become even more stark. Among the landlocked nations, the richest outside of Europe is actually Botswana, which has diamonds.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt9uvMzxhbE
"Geography and Development, Trade","Pretty lucky for them. What you also notice is that  all of these countries here, they are all in Africa. In fact, Africa has more landlocked countries than any other continent. Let's take a close look at why this is the case. Okay, here is a standard-looking map of the world you probably all seen it before.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt9uvMzxhbE
"Geography and Development, Trade","It's not obvious from this map  why Africa should be particularly landlocked. But there's also something funny about this map, something odd. Take a look at Greenland. Greenland on this map looks huge, it looks almost as big as Africa. And, yet, when you check the statistics, what you find is that Greenland is,  in fact, 1/11 the size of Africa.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt9uvMzxhbE
"Geography and Development, Trade","What's going on? Well, this is actually an illusion. It's an illusion created by  the particular projection we've used, the Mercator projection, -- to project a 3D surface,  namely a globe, onto 2 dimensions. Whenever you take a 3D surface and you map it in 2 dimensions, you are bound to get some illusions. And in this case,  we get the illusion of size.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt9uvMzxhbE
"Geography and Development, Trade","Let's take a look at  a different projection. This is the Albers Projection, which maintains equal sizes areas. We are going to get some illusions  about the shape of continents, but we are going to get  the right equivalent sizes. And on this projection  what you see, quite correctly, is that Greenland  is much smaller than Africa. What you also see is that Africa is huge.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt9uvMzxhbE
"Geography and Development, Trade","Africa is an enormous continent. Let's also show that in a different way. Okay, here's another way  of looking at Africa and what you can see, again, Africa is big. You can fit the entire United States, excluding Alaska, into Africa. You can put China as well into Africa.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt9uvMzxhbE
"Geography and Development, Trade","India can go into Africa. Eastern Europe, most of Europe; here's Italy, Germany, France, and Spain, and so forth. Now, remember that chunk in the United States, which is inland,  which had low GDP, well, just map that into Africa. You can see what is going on. Here's another way of looking at this.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt9uvMzxhbE
"Geography and Development, Trade","Let's go back to our projection. Take a look at the coastline of Africa. Here's the coastline of Africa. Now compare with the coastline of Europe. Well, in Europe you've got  all these nooks and crannies and inlets and seas.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt9uvMzxhbE
"Geography and Development, Trade","Here's the Black Sea over here and so forth. In fact, what you'll find if you do this, if you measure the coastline, is that the coastline of Europe, is 2-3 times longer than the coastline of Africa. 2-3 times, by the way, because it can actually differ  depending upon how you measure those fjords and so forth in Europe. The fractal nature of coastline makes it a little bit arbitrary to measure. Basic point however is, Europe is much smaller than Africa, and, yet, the coastline of Europe, the access to the ocean, access to the seas, to navigable rivers,  much much larger.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt9uvMzxhbE
"Geography and Development, Trade","So Europe has much more access to trade than does Africa. So let's review briefly. From Adam Smith, we have that sea coast and navigable rivers, that leads to trade to larger markets. Larger markets that means more specialization and improvements in knowledge, and improvements in  knowledge lead to growth. In contrast with this,  if you are landlocked, you don't get those trade, you don't get trade, you don't get larger markets you don't get that specialization, you don't get  that improvement in knowledge, and, instead, you get stagnation.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt9uvMzxhbE
"Geography and Development, Trade","Now, again, let's apply this to Africa. Adam Smith in fact had the theory and application done in 1776. He says, ""There are in Africa none of those great inlets, such as the Baltic and Adriatic seas in Europe, the Mediterranean and the Black Sea  in both Europe and Asia [...] to carry maritime commerce into the interior parts of that great continent: and the great rivers of Africa  are at too great a distance from one another to give occasion to  any considerable inland navigation"". So Adam Smith nailed in 1776 one of the key connections between geography, between access to the coast, access to navigable rivers, and development. Amazingly, it wasn't until  some 200 or so years later that Jeff Sachs and others  really began to pick this up and bring it back into the growth story.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt9uvMzxhbE
"Geography and Development, Trade","One reason to remember  our history of economic thought. Okay, we'll be looking more at development and geography, in particular malaria and other parasites and things like that, and their influences in the next lecture. Thanks.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt9uvMzxhbE
"Geography and Development, Disease","Welcome everyone. This is Development Economics. Today we're continuing our discussion of geography and development, focusing in particular on the influence of disease. So this graph shows something quite remarkable. GDP per capita increases with distance from the equator.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouMTbJiMVWA
"Geography and Development, Disease","And this is not just a northern hemisphere effect, it happens in the southern hemisphere as well. There clearly you can see, here is the United States in the northern hemisphere is very rich. Here is Japan, also in the northern hemisphere is rich. This is Canada, Italy, France, and so forth, these are all rich countries in the northern hemisphere. Over here, however, in the Southern Hemisphere, we also see, as distance from the equator increases, so does GDP per Capita.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouMTbJiMVWA
"Geography and Development, Disease","This is Australia, New Zealand, this is Argentina which is not a terribly rich country, nevertheless, it's much richer than countries which are closer to the Equator. Now down here you can't even tell what these countries are because there's so many of them but that's precisely the point you see an awful lot of very poor countries close to the equator. Naturally there are exceptions this is Singapore which has excellent institutions and manages to avoid the rule, the exception. Here is Hong Kong, this is equatorial New Guinea, which has lousy institutions, but is nevertheless quite rich per capita, although the inequality is extreme, because it has a lot of oil. You can see the same relationship on this graph which simply adds circles which are proportional to total GDP.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouMTbJiMVWA
"Geography and Development, Disease","So you have a lot of very rich countries up here, and very poor countries down here. Notice by the way that even going from the equator to a country like Argentina, we're talking about going from $1,000 or so per capita GDP to $10,000. So there are big differences even within this small range over here. So why is this? Why does GDP per capita increase with distance from the equator?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouMTbJiMVWA
"Geography and Development, Disease","Here we see the same data but in a map form. And once again outside, the Tropic of Cancer, in the northern hemisphere, we see lots of rich countries. And outside the Tropic of Capricorn in the southern hemisphere, we see richer countries. By the way, one wonders if there had been more mass down here, another continent down here. Well we might not have seen more rich far southern countries.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouMTbJiMVWA
"Geography and Development, Disease","You also see in the middle, in the equatorial regions, great poverty. Well why is this? Let's take a look at the malaria index. What you see immediately is that the malaria index is almost perfectly inverse to the GDP per capita. Now this index, it's not the number of people who get malaria, which also depends on GDP per capita.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouMTbJiMVWA
"Geography and Development, Disease","Instead this is an index of where malaria breeds, where the temperature and the water conditions are such as to make the mosquitoes. Which transmit the malaria really, very prevalent and it's where they like, where malaria likes to be. And where malaria likes to be is in the equatorial regions, particularly in Africa, but also in Asia and in South America. Now malaria is a terrible disease, it affects 300 to 500 million people every year. And every year those 300 to 500 million people, they're out for a week completely incapacitated and then for a week or two weeks after that, they're highly fatigued.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouMTbJiMVWA
"Geography and Development, Disease","A million of them will die, often young children. For the young children who survive, nor is this the end of the story because once you've had Malaria, even if you survive it it may permanently stunt your growth and lower your IQ. So we begin to see here how a disease might have influenced development and it's not just Malaria. Here's a list of diseases which are more common in the tropics. Malaria, we just mentioned, yellow fever, chagas disease, sleeping sickness, river blindness, snail fever, parasitic worms, like the roundworm, hookworm and whipworm.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouMTbJiMVWA
"Geography and Development, Disease","These worms are over a quarter of the world population is infected with at least one of these worms. About 1.4 billion people have round worm and about a billion have hook worm and another billion or so have whip worm, sometimes they have more than one. These worms, they infect the intestinal system, they drain people's energy, they reduce their ability to get nutrients. They take the vitamins for the people eat, and people consume and they suck them up. They stunt growth, they reduce people's IQ and make it harder for them to develop.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouMTbJiMVWA
"Geography and Development, Disease","They make it easier to get other diseases, pretty horrible diseases. That's a picture of roundworm, pretty terrible stuff. It's not just a direct effect of disease which matters. In development we can have both virtuous and vicious cycles. Here's an example of a virtuous cycle.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouMTbJiMVWA
"Geography and Development, Disease","Good health leads to productivity. Productivity leads to high GDP per capita, and high GDP per capita feeds into good health through investments in medicine, through investments in public infrastructure. And just in better health in general, means you're able to withstand the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. Which otherwise would kill you when you have good health you can withstand them and you're not so bad off. Good health also means that you can expect to live for a long time, and that leads to saving into investment, and saving and investment again, lead to high GDP per capita with reinforces good health.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouMTbJiMVWA
"Geography and Development, Disease","That's a virtuous circle, let's take a look at one of the vicious cycles. Here when we start off with disease, with malaria, and yellow fever, and worms, and so forth, that leads to morbidity and mortality, which of course lowers GDP directly. It also means low savings, it means stunted people, especially when they've been hit by these diseases as young children. It means low IQ, this again leads to low GDP per capita. Low GDP per capita means you don't have the money to invest in sewage plants, to invest in clean water, to invest in vitamins and vaccines and all of the things which can improve health.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouMTbJiMVWA
"Geography and Development, Disease","So here we have an example of a vicious cycle. Disease leads to poverty and poverty means it's very hard to get out of the disease cycle. There are many channels, by the way, in which this can work. So especially when you have a lot of children dying women then tend to have more children to make up for the fact that some of them are dying. And when they have a lot of kids and a lot of them are dying, it frankly doesn't make sense to invest a lot in any one of those children.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouMTbJiMVWA
"Geography and Development, Disease","You're going to be worried when a lot of your children are dying that if you invest a lot in their education, in their human capital, then they're gonna die and leave you with nothing. So, mortality leads to high fertility which leads to low schooling to again leads to low GDP per capita, that means you don't have the investment to reduce disease. That's an example of a really vicious cycle. I said that the tropics are worse for human diseases, not surprisingly also turns out there worse for diseases that attack animals and crops. Now we often think of the tropics as being lush, and indeed they are but they're also chaotic.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouMTbJiMVWA
"Geography and Development, Disease","There's also a lot of death going on in the tropics. So it's much harder in the tropics to create single crops, because they're invaded by these disease and by these parasites. In fact it turns out that frost, some frost is actually very good for agriculture and very good for GDP. What frost does is it gives the crop which you want to produce, it gives them some breathing room, it kills off the parasites. It kills off those worms, it kills off those diseases.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouMTbJiMVWA
"Geography and Development, Disease","And even though when you have frost, you get a shorter growing season. It turns out that the absence of diseases, overall, means that you get higher productivity. So holding labor and capital constant, you actually get more agricultural productivity outside of the tropics than you do within the tropics. And in particular, in regions where there's a little bit of frost, not a lot, but a little bit of frost, you can actually get much higher productivity. Bear in mind that going back to our jelly diamond talk, that even today, wheat, corn, and rice form a huge bulk of our caloric intake.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouMTbJiMVWA
"Geography and Development, Disease","And wheat grows better in the more northern climates. So does corn and even rice, though it depends upon the variety. Some varieties of rice actually also grow better in the northern climates. So, is geography destiny? No, it is not.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouMTbJiMVWA
"Geography and Development, Disease","But geography does matter. I like to think about it in the following way. The guy on the right, that's Tyrone Muggsy Bogues. He was five foot three, he played ten seasons in the NBA, and yes he could dunk. So is it impossible for a player of five foot three to make it in the NBA?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouMTbJiMVWA
"Geography and Development, Disease","No, it is not. Do we see a lot of short players in the NBA? No, we do not. Muggsy was able to overcome his inherent disadvantages and play at an incredibly high level. I kinda think of Muggsy as the Singapore of the NBA.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouMTbJiMVWA
"Geography and Development, Disease","Muggsy was hitting way above his height class in exactly the same way that Singapore is hitting above its GDP per capita class. The other guy in the picture, by the way, that's Michael Jordan, who is actually a little bit shorter than the average NBA player. So institutions clearly matter. All of the other things we have been talking about, matter. In particular, Communism really stunts growth.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouMTbJiMVWA
"Geography and Development, Disease","So if you take a look at some of our earlier figures, you'll see China and Russia are way below there GDP per capita, which you would expect. Given their really quite favorable geography given their really quite favorable climate and location and so forth. So communism stunts corruption stunts, there are a lot of countries who are doing worse than they could. Think about it this way, geography is potential, but you need good institutions to live up to your potential. There's also another twist, and that is geography can actually influence institutions, can shape some of those institutions.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouMTbJiMVWA
"Geography and Development, Disease",And we'll be talking more about that next time. Thank you.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouMTbJiMVWA
Why Agriculture is Important,"Most development economics, especially at low levels of per capita income, is about agriculture. In poor countries, agriculture simply is most of the economy, and for most of the last twelve thousand years, agriculture has been the most important economic sector in all regions of the world until of course recent industrialization. The advent of cheap readily available food is one of the greatest advances in human history. It has meant that human beings can turn their attentions and energies away from simply finding something to eat to building more important tools or  to creating more art and music or to spending more time with other  people or whatever it is they want to do. Cheap food has enabled all of this.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66XzvlI3Drc
Why Agriculture is Important,"It's common consensus that  increases in agricultural productivity are the most effective  means of poverty reduction especially for people living on,  say, a dollar or two a day. The growth in agricultural productivity brings at least two benefits: first, real incomes from  farming employment can be higher, and second, food is much  cheaper and easier to get. Agricultural revolutions are in fact the precursors of industrial revolutions. The Industrial Revolution in  England in the 18th century was preceded by significant advances in agricultural productivity. The success stories of economic  development in the 20th century were again preceded by advances in agricultural productivity.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66XzvlI3Drc
Why Agriculture is Important,"Agriculture is a base upon which  an economy can build further growth. Furthermore, simply having enough  to eat brings many indirect benefits. For instance, imagine  a child going to school hungry. The child probably will not learn very effectively. Imagine a child growing up hungry.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66XzvlI3Drc
Why Agriculture is Important,"The child will be more prone to diseases. The story of economic  development is in large part a story of cheap and  readily available foodstuffs. To read more on some of these points, look at this reference or  Google 'agriculture poverty reduction'.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66XzvlI3Drc
Industry Builds on Agriculture,"One of the best things about advances  in agricultural productivity is that they tend to spur  industrial revolutions. Consider Indonesia, the country's economy  has had its ups and downs but overall, over the last few decades it has emerged as an industrializing  exploiting nation. The industrializing processes  of the 1980s were in fact preceded  by about 15 years of strong gains  in agricultural productivity. During the 1970s, about  50 million Indonesians left poverty without the aid  of export-oriented industry. This was because of agriculture.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJ3Pes__aR0
Industry Builds on Agriculture,"For instance, between 1968 and 1985,  yields for rice, which is the staple food in Indonesia,  rose by about 80%, and total rice production grew almost  three times faster than population growth. In 1974, Indonesia was the largest  rice importer in the world. By 1984, the country  was self-sufficient in rice. Indonesia's green revolution was based  in small farmers, it was mediated through markets,  and the state played an important role in making available to farmers, high yielding fertilizer responsive  rice varieties. Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea all have  broadly similar histories in this regard.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJ3Pes__aR0
Industry Builds on Agriculture,"That is, their processes  of industrialization were preceded by significant productivity gains  in agriculture. These market developments were supported  by their governments through building the right kinds  of infrastructure, rural education, and in general  supporting and encouraging research and development in agriculture, in addition to the more general role  of those governments in creating a stable  economic environment. Agricultural growth helps boost  industrialization in a few ways. For one thing, the more productive  is agriculture, the easier it is for some workers  to shift from farms to factories in larger cities. Furthermore, agriculture  produces a surplus and this mobilizes domestic savings, which can be used to finance investment as indeed was the case in the East Asian  economic miracles.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJ3Pes__aR0
Industry Builds on Agriculture,"Finally, there may be  an intangible effect, a country which has  some success in agriculture starts to believe it can have  economic success more generally. Interestingly, Japan, Taiwan,  and South Korea all engaged in significant programs  of land reform in the periods leading up  to their industrialization. Basically, land was taken  away from landlords and given to smaller farmers and tenants. Cause and effect are hard  to disentangle here, but it seems that this may have boosted  agricultural productivity and it also may have contributed  to a general sense of fairness and helped the later democratization  of these countries. There was now a greater chance  that these countries would have a stable middle class.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJ3Pes__aR0
Industry Builds on Agriculture,"Overall, information on these topics  is fairly diffused and spread out. You could try David Henley, ""The Agrarian  Roots of Industrial Growth,"" or just Google, ""East Asian  miracle agriculture"" to get to some good sources.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJ3Pes__aR0
Green Revolution,"The Green Revolution is one of the most important events of the 20th century and it has led to many  millions of people being fed when they otherwise would  have starved or gone hungry. A green revolution refers  most generally to an increase in  the productivity of agriculture. But our green revolution  starts with Norman Borlaug, an American who eventually  won a Nobel Peace Prize. Borlaug was an American scientist  and in the mid 1940s he found himself working in central Mexico as part of a Rockefeller Foundation  program to improve crop yields. He came up with some major breakthroughs, including rust-resistant wheat crops, shuttle breeding programs  to accelerate crop engineering and stronger and  higher yielding wheat plants.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymMajMVCFhk
Green Revolution,"Rather than just keeping this knowledge to himself, Borlaug tried to spread it to  his many Mexican farmers as possible. And among the Mexican farmers,  he was known for his willingness to get his hands dirty and just go over there out in the fields and work with them. Basically, these ideas worked. Borlaug is best thought of as a kind of genius offshoot innovator from  a more general increase of agricultural productivity in the United States. For instance, between 1880 and 1940, agricultural productivity  in the United States was going up by about 1 percent a year.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymMajMVCFhk
Green Revolution,"That's OK, but after World War II, the trend rate of growth went up to about 2.8 percent a year. So this was a time when American agriculture itself was flourishing. This was due to more and better fertilizer, greater and better use of mechanized vehicles, better crops and hybrids, larger farms, and in general the application of  large-scale business and business management to growing food. Borlaug took some of these ideas,  improved them and adapted them for use  to developing countries. In the early 1960s, the green revolution started to spread to South Asia, most notably India and Pakistan.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymMajMVCFhk
Green Revolution,"And this was due in large part to  the personal efforts of Norman Borlaug. During 1969 to 1970, 55% of the wheat hectares sown in Pakistan used Mexican or Mexican derived varieties of wheat. In India it was 35% of wheat hectares sown. Domestic farmers in India and Pakistan were big advocates of this green revolution and they did the rest of the work and their political leaders allowed  this change to happen. By 1970, the countries with significant increases in cereal production due to the green revolution were Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, then called Ceylon, Indonesia, Iran, Kenya, Morocco, Malaysia, Thailand, Tunisia and Turkey.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymMajMVCFhk
Green Revolution,"Later in the 1970s,  Borlaug encouraged the Chinese to move to a more productive  variety of hybrid rice. Before the green revolution,  it was a common prediction that the developing world was  facing a future of mass starvation. In large part this green revolution  was not foreseen by commentators. Now, it's the case that the world is  feeding many more people than ever before. Yield rates on various crops  rose dramatically.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymMajMVCFhk
Green Revolution,"They rose for grains, they rose  for cereals, they rose for a rice and they rose most of all for wheat by nearly a factor of fourfold. That's a comparison 1950 to 1998 for India kilograms per hectare. The green revolution has  been extremely impressive and of course much of the developing world picked up where Norman Borlaug left off.

Land reform in India,"Land reform is a hard issue to study because it's difficult to see what would have happened in the absence of land reform. Nonetheless, let's take a look at a bit of what we know. We're going to look at this piece  by Tim Besley and Robin Burgess on India. Keep in mind, in general,  the economic results of land reform can be either positive or negative. The negative scenario is  pretty straightforward.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5pULFSDAH4
Land reform in India,"If the government confiscates or somehow alters property rights on land, investors may be less willing to put resources into agricultural improvements. Security of property rights is an important precondition for economic growth. On the positive side, land reform  may remedy an inequality, and it also may give people  who work on the land a greater stake  in agricultural productivity, and thus increase their effort,  because, after land reform, they're not simply working for other people. The relative strength of these various effects, of course, depends on context and we're going to look at data  from 1958 to 1992, from the major Indian states. What makes the paper work is that  the authors were able to compare the Indian states which had  a good deal of land reform to the Indian states which did not.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5pULFSDAH4
Land reform in India,"So, under the years of consideration, there was a lot of land reform  in Kerala and Tamil Nadu, but there was not nearly as much in Rajasthan and Punjab. There are four possible types of  land reform during this period. The first was reforming  the terms of tenancy contracts. That is, a state government would intervene and regulate the contract ostensibly in the interest of the tenant. For instance, this kind of regulation might have stipulated that a tenant would receive a minimum share of the output from the land.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5pULFSDAH4
Land reform in India,"Second, another kind of land reform would abolish intermediaries. Going back to British colonial rule  and also earlier, typically there were feudal lords who would own land and they would hire intermediaries to extract additional revenue  from the people working the land. Most Indian states already had abolished these intermediaries before 1958, but it turns out that five Indian states abolished these intermediaries  only after 1958. Third, another kind of land reform could put a ceiling on how much land  a single landowner could hold. And finally, the fourth kind of land reform could allow for a consolidation  of landholdings and, in effect, remove ceilings on how much land an individual landholder could hold.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5pULFSDAH4
Land reform in India,"It's going to turn out these four kinds of land reform have different effects, and, in general, when someone talks  about land reform, land reform isn't a single thing, it can mean many different things with, of course, different economic analysis for each. When we look at the data, it turns out that land reform really is correlated with a falling rate of rural poverty. Yet, it's only two kinds of  land reform which matter: its tenancy reforms and  the abolition of intermediaries. Legislation having to do with land ceilings, and land holdings, and concentration don't seem to matter for rural poverty. You might wonder, what does this correlation mean?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5pULFSDAH4
Land reform in India,"After all, it's possible that the very existence of land reform is simply proxying for a fact  that maybe a state cares about its poor citizens in some other way. So land reform and the decline  in rural poverty may be correlated not because there's a causal relationship but because land reform is  proxying for other policies. To try to take this into account,  the authors also look at urban poverty rates. If land reform were proxying for  a more general set of policies, we would expect land reform  to be correlated with especially steep falls  in urban poverty rates, but it turns out that it's not. So maybe there is some unique  rural effect resulting from land reform.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5pULFSDAH4
Land reform in India,"Nonetheless, not all of the economic  effects of land reform are positive. Following a reform in tenancy regulations, it actually turns out that  agricultural output per capita falls. What does this mean? Poverty is going down, but agricultural output  per capita is going down too. It seems to be that what's happening is the way the land is being worked is less efficient, but more of the gains of what  are being produced are going to the poor people  working the land.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5pULFSDAH4
Land reform in India,"In other words, there's  an equity-efficiency trade-off. Land reform does seem  to make matters more equitable, but it also makes agricultural  production less efficient when we're talking about land reform that affects the terms of  contracts with tenants. That was pretty close to our original  microeconomic analysis, namely that land reform can  have some negative effects and land reform can also have  some positive effects. Just to put together a few results  from the paper on one slide. Following some kinds of land reform, rural poverty goes down,  agricultural wages go up, rural per capita income  from agriculture goes down following reforms to tenancy, and there's an equity-efficiency trade-off for tenancy reform, but there's no equity efficiency trade-off for abolishing intermediaries.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5pULFSDAH4
Land reform in India,"When you abolish intermediaries  from that kind of land reform, there's no negative effect on rural  per capita income from agriculture. Overall, there's a great deal which  economists do not know about land reform and land reform is very difficult to study systematically. it really does depend on context, whether the positive or the negative results will be more important. Nonetheless, this paper is at least a start on a very difficult topic.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5pULFSDAH4
China's agricultural reforms,the agricultural reforms which started in China in 1978 are likely to go down as one of the more important events in human history. These reforms moved China away from the system of collectivism towards a greater reliance on individual responsiblity and private property rights. ` Since the Communist revolution agricultural productivity hadnt done so well in China. The land actually had been more productive in 1949 than it was in 1978. .,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uApFDXsat18
China's agricultural reforms,"During the late 1950's during the so called great leap forward it is estimated that there are possibly as many as 30 million Chinese died of starvation In part it was the collectivism that took away the incentivism to grow food but another problem is that when there were shortages of food in some parts of the country there was no commercial incentive to ship food supplies to places where people really needed something to eat. Before the reforms of 1978, a rural farm was typically run by a collectivised commune, a collective bureaucary was incahrge of the farm but there werent actually many incentives for farmers to either work hard or work smart. The return of a farmer was deteremined by how many days of work that farmer was measured having put into his farm but of course there are many ways having a day of work recorded on the books without either working very hard or working very smart. The incentive for value creation simply werent there. One ray of light came in this Chinese village in eastern china in Decemeber 1978.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uApFDXsat18
China's agricultural reforms,18 of the local farmers met in the largest house in the village. I wont attempt the pronounciation of the name of the village which is in a tonal language. In any case the farmers agreed to break the law by dividing the land taking it away from collective ownership and tunring it into individual family plots Each plot would be worked by an individual family and the return from that land would also be kept by that family. This was againt the law and actually the farmers were risking execution or being thrown into prison. the farmers also made an agreement that if any of them were killed or taken away they other families would help raise their children.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uApFDXsat18
China's agricultural reforms,but this village really knew how important agriculatural productivity was . For instance when Chinese agriculture had hard times between 1958 and 1960. 67 villagers out of a 120 actually died in this viallage alone These 18 local farmers knew that something had to change Productivty rose immediately. Of course the local communist party authorities oppossed such a move but very rapidly other villagers followed in to the same thing. Shortly thereafter the leaders of China devidede that they would reform agriculture as a whole.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uApFDXsat18
China's agricultural reforms,New private incenetives were introduced throughout all of Chinese agriculture .,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uApFDXsat18
"Fertilizer, roads, and Africa","Lack of fertilizer and lack of good roads can be serious problems for growing food. Consider sub-Saharan Africa. Food production is actually  10% lower today than it was in 1960. Of the 800 million or so people in the world who lack adequate access to food, about a quarter of them  are in sub-Saharan Africa. Since 1990, the number of  hungry people in sub-Saharan Africa has unfortunately increased by about 20%.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jkVXI-oXw
"Fertilizer, roads, and Africa","There are some blooming  success stories such as Ghana, but, overall, when it comes to agriculture the continent lags far behind. Dry or arid conditions afflict over 40% of the rural population in Africa. And of the crop area of Africa, irrigation covers only about 4%. Compare that to the 39%  covered in South Asia. Cropland per capita has been going down for decades.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jkVXI-oXw
"Fertilizer, roads, and Africa","And this mean that the same soil  has to be used over and over again and that soil tends to become  degraded and less fertile. Commonly, farmers cope with  these problems by using fertilizer, but in Africa it's not always that simple. One problem is military  conflict in Africa, another is simply that so many African nations are landlocked. But another huge problem is simply the quality and the number of the roads. Africa has the least developed  road system of any major continent.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jkVXI-oXw
"Fertilizer, roads, and Africa","The nation of Uganda, for instance, has only 94 kilometers of  paved road for each 1 million people. To put that in context, the nation of France has almost 13,000 kilometers of paved road per million people. The net result is that it's very hard to get fertilizer to many parts of Africa. And that's why the price of fertilizer in Africa is actually 2 to 6 times higher than the average world price. That's right, this is  the poorest continent and it has the agriculture in most need of fertilizer.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jkVXI-oXw
"Fertilizer, roads, and Africa","And because of bad  transportation and infrastructure, it has to pay 2 to 6 times more to get fertilizer to its crops. The net result is that, per hectare, fertilizer use in Africa is less  than 10% of the world average.

Also, try googling terms like ""fertilizer more expensive Africa"".",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jkVXI-oXw
"Wheat, water, and Saudi Arabia (Optional)","This is a short tale about individuals who reject the ideas of comparative advantage and benefits from international trade. In the 1970s, Saudi Arabia ended up  as a much wealthier country in large part because the price  of oil had gone up so much. The Saudis then set out and decided  that they were going to grow more food. Now, upon reflection,  Saudi Arabia is not naturally a low-cost country for growing most foodstuffs. The kingdom of Saudi Arabia essentially has no lakes or rivers to speak of, and only a small part of the country gets enough natural rainfall to grow food.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=St9S2tTMe3Q
"Wheat, water, and Saudi Arabia (Optional)","So, for the most part, a decision  to grow more food in Saudi Arabia meant a decision to  subsidize water irrigation. In particular, the Saudi set out to grow more wheat. Over the years 1980 to 1992, they expanded their wheat  production by a factor of 29. Saudi Arabia became the sixth largest wheat exporter in the world they were even exporting  wheat to the Soviet Union. How did such a dry country manage this?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=St9S2tTMe3Q
"Wheat, water, and Saudi Arabia (Optional)","Well they did it by massive  subsidies to wheat growing and massive subsidies to  water irrigation for wheat. So, in Saudi Arabia, wheat production  would cost around $500 a ton when the market price was,  at the same time, about $120 a ton. By growing their own wheat, the Saudis were making it almost five times more expensive. The Saudis also wasted a lot of water. To grow all this wheat it required  300 billion cubic meters of water, most of it non-renewable.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=St9S2tTMe3Q
"Wheat, water, and Saudi Arabia (Optional)","To put that in perspective, that's about  equal to 6 years flow of water of the Nile river into Egypt. Over time however, the Saudis decided they simply couldn't afford  all of these expenses and in the year 2008 they decided to essentially give up on their wheat growing program with the goal that wheat  production in Saudi Arabia would essentially be gone by 2016. It's already the case that there are plenty of wheat farms out there in Saudi Arabia where the equipment is sitting there unused, simply gathering rust. In this case, it would have been  much cheaper for the Saudis to have relied on international  trade from the very beginning. The Saudis made this mistake of  starting to grow weed in the first place in part because they thought they  could achieve national self-sufficiency, in part because they could show the population that they were somehow  modernizing as a nation, in part because they've simply got carried away from having so much surplus cash, and also because subsidizing wheat  was a way of handing out goodies to a growing farm lobby.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=St9S2tTMe3Q

"Yams, a man's crop? (Optional)","Not many courses on development economics have a segment on yams, but we do. Yams are very often  a staple in West Africa and, indeed, 95% of the world's  yam crop is grown in West Africa. Yams aren't traded much across  national borders for at least two reasons. The first is simply that much of West Africa doesn't have good infrastructure for  transporting yams long distance. Second, yams can be stored quite easily for up to six months without refrigeration.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCJUAVvVB20
"Yams, a man's crop? (Optional)","So, if you're a farmer and you have grown extra yams, and probably you're a poor farmer, well, you'll just keep those yams around as a kind of insurance against insufficient food in the future. The easier the yam is to store the less necessity there is to trade it right away. In West African lore it's sometimes said that yams are a man's crop. This is because men tend to grow yams. In general, in many parts  of Western Africa, husband and wives farm separate  plots and grow separate crops.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCJUAVvVB20
"Yams, a man's crop? (Optional)","For instance, if a crop has something  to do with a tree or a vine it is more likely to be grown by a man. But who controls the income  from these different crops? Well, this can be studied. When it turns out that the pattern  of rainfall is good for the crops which the women grow, the family's expenditures  tend to shift toward food. When the pattern of rainfall is good  for the crops which the man tends to grow, yams aside, the family expenditure tends to shift toward alcohol, and tobacco, and prestige goods.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCJUAVvVB20
"Yams, a man's crop? (Optional)","In the Ivory Coast where  the study was conducted the yams are grown by men but the income from yams in particular is directed toward family ends. So, in the pattern of rainfall is such that it is good for yams, the family's expenditures tend  to go up on education and food. It seems that we're observing  a segregation of income streams. That is, the woman's crops go to  the priorities of the woman, some of the man's crops go to  the priorities of the man, and then there is this crop yams  which are specifically dedicated to the priorities of the family. One lesson from this paper  is that, even within families, there are not perfect insurance markets and there is not perfect  insurance against risk.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCJUAVvVB20
"Yams, a man's crop? (Optional)","In a pure economic model where trade and insurance work perfectly, you would expect that the man and  the woman in a family would make a deal so that when the income from  the man's crops is high he would share some of  that with the woman and when the income from  the woman's crops is high she would share some of  that with the man and what would matter for  the spending pattern is not in particular, did the man's crops do well or  did the woman's crops do well but rather how did all  the crops do in general? It's that kind of perfect insurance which we exactly do not see. Income from yams is used for  a kind of insurance like purpose, but, in general, income from  the other crops is not. This analysis is taken  from a very good paper by Esther Duflo and Christopher Udry. You can google to it online.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCJUAVvVB20

The Soy Boom (Optional),"Commodity booms have been an important source of economic growth for a lot of the developing world over the last decade. Let's look at one extreme  example, namely, the soy boom. Some of the major producers  of soy are located in the new world. There's the United States; there's Brazil,  especially in the interior; there is Argentina; there's Bolivia and there's Paraguay. For a lot of the 20th century,  Paraguay was a slow growing nation, but, in the last ten years or so, things have really picked up.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l8Y5h3JCB4
The Soy Boom (Optional),"For instance, in the year 2010, Paraguay grew at about 15% a year. That's an astonishing number. This occurred not because of any great improvement in economic policy but mostly because of soy. Right now, soy accounts for more than one half of the exports from Paraguay. As in Argentina and Brazil, significant parts of the interior of  the country are being turned over to soy production.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l8Y5h3JCB4
The Soy Boom (Optional),"This is what the plant looks like  when it's being grown in the field. Many of you may be  eating soy in the form of tofu. That is not however the main use  for the soy plant and the soybean. The main use of soy is an animal feed, for instance, feed for cows. Soy is an important protein for this feed and it's a relatively cheap  protein for this feed.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l8Y5h3JCB4
The Soy Boom (Optional),"So, as individuals in the developing world eat more meat, this means that more cows are raised, if more cows are raised,  more cows have to be fed, and more cows will be fed soy,  and more soy will be grown. This is basically the source  of the recent soy boom. Historically, a lot of commodity  booms have been unstable. The price of the commodity goes way up much more of the commodity is produced. Then the price goes down  and a commodity boom is followed by a commodity bust.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l8Y5h3JCB4
The Soy Boom (Optional),"What will happen with soy? We'll see, but there's at least one reason to be more optimistic, and that is a lot of food  demands are fairly stable. When individuals in a country  start developing a taste for meat, they don't always give it up so easily. If this proves to be the case, perhaps the soy boom in  South America will prove enduring. If you'd like to read more on the soy boom, you could start by googling these terms.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l8Y5h3JCB4
The Clove Monopoly (Optional),"Indonesia is one of the world's  largest suppliers of cloves and the clove sector is one of  their largest employers and also taxpayers. In this picture, the clothes are in the bottom left. They're these little things here. I like to use them for  cooking and making curries but in Indonesia most cloves go towards cigarettes. Clove cigarettes are extremely popular in the country.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_qTJxkhz-k
The Clove Monopoly (Optional),"In 1992, a cloves monopoly  was set up in Indonesia. One trading board was given the exclusive right both to buy cloves from clove farmers and to sell those cloves  to the cigarette industry. This trading board then had  both monopoly power and also what economists call  monopsony power, namely, it being the single buyer of clothes from farmers. So what do you think happened? This trading board  with exclusive power was able to get away with  paying very little for the cloves when buying to the farmers, but it was able to charge  a very high price for those cloves when it turned around and sold them to the cigarette companies.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_qTJxkhz-k
The Clove Monopoly (Optional),"So, basically all of the profits in  this industry were sucked into this monopolistic, monopsonistic  cloves support and trading board. One agricultural economist commented: ""Cloves are one of the most distorted  industries in the history of the world"". You may wonder, by the way, who was running this trading board and receiving the income from it. Well, it was a fellow named Tommy Suharto. And Tommy Suharto was the youngest son of the country's president.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_qTJxkhz-k
The Clove Monopoly (Optional),"Maybe you're not surprised by that. The good news is that the cloves monopoly and monopsony was disbanded later in the 1990s. The IMF, in fact, insisted upon this as a condition for  granting aid to Indonesia to help that country cope with  its financial crisis at the time. By the way, some years later,  Tommy Suharto was sent to jail. He was found to have ordered the assassination of a supreme court judge in Indonesia.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_qTJxkhz-k
The Clove Monopoly (Optional),"It seems he wasn't  actually that nice a guy. But this isn't just a problem  with Tommy Suharto. There is a more general  research about Indonesia. There's one paper that looked at the 20,000 manufacturing firms in Indonesia and labeled which of those firms were politically connected and which were not. It turns out that if a firm was considered to be politically connected, its chance of receiving an import license was three times higher.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_qTJxkhz-k
The Clove Monopoly (Optional),"Keep in mind, in Indonesia,  at this point in time, there's a lot of protectionism,  there's not very much free trade and very often companies need  import licenses to buy imports -- from abroad and even to stay in business at all. It was also found that  if one of these firms had a member of the Suharto family on the board of directors of that company, the chance of receiving a required  import license went up by four times. The good news, however,  is that since this time Indonesia has been liberalizing  its trade relationships and the country has been doing better and growing at a more rapid pace.

Watermelon scale economies (Optional),"This video unit is drawn more  from my personal experience than from any kind of formal research, and it concerns watermelons. There's a small Mexican village  which I visited many times. It's called San AgustÃ­n Oapan and it has about 1,500 inhabitants. Some of the individuals in San AgustÃ­n; they grow watermelons and they grow them down by the river. The river itself fertilizes  the bank of the river, so there's no formal fertilizer  they need to spend money on.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikzM8mvFkIE
Watermelon scale economies (Optional),"And, also, in this village,  wage rates are pretty low. So, quite commonly, an individual  might work and earn, say, a dollar or two a day. So, you have zero fertilizer costs  and you have very low wage costs. And if a watermelon is going to be sold, well, when it is ripe, they take it from the river  and they basically walk it up, it's a short 10 or 15-minute walk, and they bring it to a house in town where it's sold as if it would be sold in a store. So, for those watermelons, all of the costs are low.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikzM8mvFkIE
Watermelon scale economies (Optional),"We have low costs. The capital costs are quite low, the labor costs are low. Also, the land costs are low. There aren't so many other useful things you can do with that land. The key point here is that when you take that watermelon in San AgustÃ­n and it goes up for sale, depending on the size or the quality; but, basically, it sells for in the range of 5 to 7 U.S. dollar.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikzM8mvFkIE
Watermelon scale economies (Optional),"For your convenience, that's converting Mexican pesos into U.S. dollars of course. What I find striking is the comparison between the watermelon in San AgustÃ­n and the watermelons as you find them in a U.S. Supermarket. Watermelons in the United States are farmed using modern techniques. They also may be transported  from a state like Texas or Florida to wherever it is your supermarket is. The supermarket itself  has fairly high expenses, they may be advertising  the sale of watermelons, there are refrigeration costs and much, much more.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikzM8mvFkIE
Watermelon scale economies (Optional),"The thing is the American retail infrastructure is producing and selling a large number of watermelons. So, all of those costs  spread out over, as I said, a very large number of watermelons. Per watermelon, those costs end up being so low that what a watermelon sells for in the United States is about from 5 to 7 dollars, again, depending on exact  size, quality, and time of year. And that's exactly the same price that it sells for in San AgustÃ­n Oapan. The lesson here is one of  economies of scale and the San AgustÃ­n economy; it's literally the case that most of  the important costs are zero or near zero.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikzM8mvFkIE
Watermelon scale economies (Optional),"In the United States, you can see what appear to be a large number of  quite significant costs. But, again, when you spread out those costs over a large number of production units, per unit, those costs  also are extremely small. You can think of this as an object lesson in the efficiency of food systems, and food distribution and retail systems, which can take advantage  of economies of scale.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikzM8mvFkIE
Economic import of water,"Water is one of the most important issues in most developing economies. By most estimates, there are well over a billion people in the world who do not have access to clean and safe water. It was once said that if the cure for HIV/AIDS were simply a glass of clean and safe water there would still be plenty of people who would have no access to that cure. One reason why water economics is important is agriculture. In a lot of developing nations,  agriculture is by far the biggest user of water.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZlVE5qXxzo
Economic import of water,"To have healthy thriving and  productive agriculture, of course, one needs a reliable source of water and that isn't always there. Good health is probably the most serious reason why water economics matters. Cholera, diarrhea, and a lot of  stomach and blood diseases are transmitted by water. It's quite literally true  that, every year, millions of people die,  many of them children, because they do not have access to clean and safe water. A study done in Karachi, Pakistan, found that people with no sewerage and no hygiene knowledge had medical bills about six times higher than a comparable group of people who did have sewerage and some knowledge of hygiene.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZlVE5qXxzo
Economic import of water,"A neglected factor in  water economics often is time. If you don't have a good piped water connection, you may have to walk miles to get your water. This can sometimes take up  to six hours a day and a lot of the burden falls  on women and girls. That means less time to care for children or less time to study schoolwork. It's been estimated that, each year, about 10 million person-years are spent just going to get water  and bringing it back home.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZlVE5qXxzo
Economic import of water,"And of course this carried water  is a lot more expensive than water from a tap. It can cost as much as  five to ten times more and, of course, these are very poor individuals having to pay the price. Industry also needs  a source of reliable water. For all of these reasons and more, water economics is central  to economic development.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZlVE5qXxzo
Water markets and ethics,"Very often, people have  strong ethical intuitions about how water supply should operate. Let's look just a bit at  how this influences the actual supply of water. It's a common view that water is somehow part of the common heritage of mankind, or that it belongs to the planet,  or that it belongs to nature. And thus, as a result, many people  have the ethical intuition that water should not be made  an object of private property. It seems wrong that an individual  or a corporation could somehow capture or corral a body of water  or a flow of water and say, ""This is mine, this is not yours"".",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwNLSKeNYiE
Water markets and ethics,"Imagine that you would be riding a camel in the desert and be very thirsty  and need water to live, and you would come across an oasis and some private individual  would own that water and say, ""If you want this water, you have to pay me a million dollars, a billion dollars, whatever"". To many people, that simply seems wrong and that's part of this intuition that water should not be  the subject of private property. It's not my goal here to discuss whether this intuition is right or wrong per se, but there is an economic angle to the intuition. Once we take something  like water or food and we say that it cannot  become private property, that a corporation or an individual  cannot charge for supplying that water or supplying that food. What do we typically get?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwNLSKeNYiE
Water markets and ethics,"We typically get a shortage or an extreme scarcity, because no one has the incentive  to supply that water, to bring it to your home, to make sure that the water supply is replenished and maintained and looked after. So an economic perspective on  these normative intuitions; it's a little more pragmatic. It doesn't try to take on or battle  the intuitions directly, but it simply points out that the end of supplying more people with better water and cheaper water will,  in some circumstances, be done better when we, in fact, allow private property rights in water. So what's the alternative to allowing someone to exercise a property right or dominion over a water resource? Well, it would mean that it's very hard  to get systemic institutional control, maintenance and management of a water supply.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwNLSKeNYiE
Water markets and ethics,"You could imagine an open public well where people go to the well and carry water back to their homes, and water is more expensive and maybe less clean and maybe less good for people's health. So there is a pragmatic  argument for allowing a considerable degree of property rights  when it comes to the supply of water, even though, I think, we all understand the intuition that water is, in part, in some manner, the common heritage of mankind.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwNLSKeNYiE
Water and Monopoly,"Monopoly means higher price,  restricted output, difficulty of getting a connection  due to expense, and sometimes also it means lower quality. But why are there so many monopoly problems in the water sector. There are some ways of getting water which are actually quite competitive. Imagine, for instance, walking to a well with a bucket, filling the bucket with water, and carrying the bucket back to your house. You could do it, your friend could do it, your sister could do it, you could hire people to do it for you, there might be many  wells you could go to.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0YwqB3N08E
Water and Monopoly,"There would be a lot of competition. The problem with this competition is that carrying water on your head, back to your house, and walking for maybe, as much as, two or three hours; that's extremely costly. So, the competitive way of buying and selling water doesn't always work. What's the cheaper way  of getting water to your house? Well, think about it, running pipes into your home; you then go to the sink, you turn on the tap, the water comes out.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0YwqB3N08E
Water and Monopoly,"It turns out that getting water through pipes is, generally, much cheaper than having to carry it on your head or carry it in a bucket using your hands. The pipes, however, also give rise to a monopoly problem. And, that is, it's very expensive to lay water pipes from a source going into people's homes. You can well imagine that we could have two, three, four different companies, each laying their own set of water pipes and then you would have  some degree of competition. But the problem then is that  you would have to pay for two, three, four different sets of water pipes leading into the home.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0YwqB3N08E
Water and Monopoly,"When the cost of  the pipe is relatively high, relative to what's being  put through the pipe, we then say there are high fixed costs, and having then competition  turns out to be relatively costly. And once you decide there's going to be only one main set of pipes running to a home, then you're back to monopoly problems. Even if you can arrange that four or five different sellers of water are selling their water through those pipes. The person or institution who owns  and controls those pipes still has a considerable degree  of influence over the market. It's very much the same kind of  problem we see with electricity.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0YwqB3N08E
Water and Monopoly,"That is, a relatively high cost of  putting up the wires and relatively low cost of transmitting  the electricity on the wires or, for that matter, cable television. The real cost there is putting  the so-called piping, the cable TV hookups to the homes, and the actual cost of transmitting the programs is low. So, the general point is this. When you have high fixed costs,  which come from something like piping, it's much harder to have competition in the provision of a good or service.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0YwqB3N08E
Privatizing urban water,"Privatizing urban water  in developing nations has been a trend since the 1990s. The idea came from some water privatizations in England and Wales, which seemed to work. And so, a number of governments in developing nations wanted to supply more water  to their people, didn't always have the resources  immediately at hand and so they looked at the private sector. The wave of private sector  water projects in the 1990s were a response to some of  the failures of the public sector. Public sector water institutions, in general, had very little, or no, or negative incentive to extend water coverage to  a greater number of poor individuals.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9L6VIHnX2g
Privatizing urban water,"They also had very weak incentives to keep up the quality of their water services. The general operating procedure  for the public water institutions was to have a fairly low price but extremely low quality,  a lot of shortages, a lot of problems with piping,  a lot of unaccounted for water. Institutional failure was rife. This first wave of private water projects; they didn't always go well, and, sometimes, they led to prices  which were too high instead of too low. But they very definitely did extend  water services to many more people.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9L6VIHnX2g
Privatizing urban water,"In the following decade, a second wave of water privatization came, often involving a series of  flexible mixed models with public-private partnerships rather than outright  water privatizations per se. The idea of water privatization  does seem to be sticking. Private operators were serving less than 1% of the urban population in developing countries in 1997. By the year 2007, that had gone up to about 7%. Private water supply is still  very much the exception, but it's an exception which  is growing in importance.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9L6VIHnX2g
Privatizing urban water,"For some basic background on the economics and history of private water supply, see these sources in addition to some of the other video units.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9L6VIHnX2g
Cochabamba water privatization,"Cochabamba is  the third-largest city in Bolivia. In 1999, they privatized  their water supply, but the next year, 2000,  the entire thing was undone. This turned out to be  a very dramatic event. It's been a focal point of protest for people who oppose the idea of privatized water, and it became a focal point of protest  for the anti-globalization movement. So let's look just a little more closely at exactly what happened.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOOKWktvoQI
Cochabamba water privatization,"Prior to privatization, the water situation in Cochabamba was fairly grim. The government company covered  only 57% of the population and they had 50% losses in terms of  what's called unaccounted for water. Most of that came from leakages. There were serious problems  of water availability, there was lots of water rationing, there were often problems  with water pressure, and in general no one really was happy  with how things had been. Large numbers of people were dependent either on private wells or private vendors, and those sources of water  were more expensive, hard to carry, time-consuming, and had  numerous other disadvantages.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOOKWktvoQI
Cochabamba water privatization,"The contract started  in November of 1999, and by January 1st there was  an average water price increase of about 35%. Part of the problem was that  the price had gone up but people didn't yet see  any way in which their water service quality  had gotten better. So of course they were upset. At first, there were  roadblocks and strikes; the price for water was reduced a bit. Then there was a shutdown of the city,  people still were unhappy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOOKWktvoQI
Cochabamba water privatization,"There was police repression, a lot of people were injured,  many were imprisoned. And, by the time we get to spring,  what had happened is there were frequent riots in Cochabamba, there were numerous people  dead and injured, and, overall, it had become  a crisis of national and of even  international importance. It was portrayed as a kind  of classic battle between indigenous peasants and  profit-making private corporations. One of the biggest problems  with this privatization was that it also created  a lot of coercive monopoly power. Most significantly, the private company  which was granted the franchise also was given monopolistic rights  over the provision of all water services within Cochabamba.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOOKWktvoQI
Cochabamba water privatization,"Now, this turned out to be  quite important precisely because the water supply had been so bad, rich and middle-class very often used wells and storage tanks for their water supply, and very often the poor used  a tanker-based vendor or some other source, sometimes even just collecting the rainwater. All of a sudden these new sources  were actually supposed to legally come under control  of the private company. Many people felt, quite justifiably, that all of a sudden their water  had been taken away from them and that the rain, which was  falling from the sky or the water coming up  in private wells, was all of a sudden supposed to be controlled by this private company. This only fed the sense of injustice. So what finally happened?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOOKWktvoQI
Cochabamba water privatization,"By April of 2000, actual control of the water  was given back to a public company and the experiment and  privatization was at an end. It really really was a disaster,  it was done very poorly, and it created a lot of bad publicity  for the idea of privatization even at a global level. The entire episode also set  a bad precedent, that is, all of the negotiations and decision-making over the setting of the prices of water, these basically went through the central government, and they very rapidly  became political issues when, at least in theory, they were supposed to have been handled  by the water regulator. So the notion of having  an independent water regulator which would somehow apply  objectively a set of regulations to a company based on rule of law; the Cochabamba example showed  that this had failed. The entire process became  politicized very quickly.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOOKWktvoQI
Cochabamba water privatization,"The saddest news however is this: when the water supply was  returned to the public sector, actually, water provision  didn't really get any better, and, to this day, water provision  in Cochabamba remains a very serious problem. If you'd like a good source on  this entire episode, read this article.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOOKWktvoQI
Water and asymmetric information,"Another general problem with  the water sector is what's called asymmetric information. It affects both public and private  sector suppliers of water services. A symmetric information means that one person knows something that the other person doesn't. In this context, imagine that  a business knows how much it costs for them  to produce water services but the outside regulator or  government does not know. This can lead to inefficiency  and cost escalation.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jwleEv0MYQ
Water and asymmetric information,"For instance, imagine  a government water company which sets fairly low prices for its water. The company does this in part because the government wants to be popular with its citizens or with its voters, and they like having low prices for water. But the low prices for the water mean that the company does not turn a profit and rather suffers a loss. The company then has  to make up that difference. So, what the company does is to go to the government and ask for more money  to make up that difference.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jwleEv0MYQ
Water and asymmetric information,"So, how does this work? The government says to the company, ""What are your costs? How much money do you need for us to make up that difference""? The company, of course,  now has an incentive to lie. If the company needs, say, $2 million to make up the difference, the company might respond  to the government, ""We need 10 million dollars  to make up that difference"".",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jwleEv0MYQ
Water and asymmetric information,"The problem here, of course, is,  again, the asymmetric information. The government doesn't know whether  it needs to send 10 million, or 2 million, or some other sum to the company. One option is for the government to send the $10 million to the company. But how is this gonna work  the next time around? Well, then maybe the company will ask for $20 million, or $30 million, or $40 million and because the government doesn't really know the company's costs, obviously, in this case,  costs will escalate.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jwleEv0MYQ
Water and asymmetric information,"An alternative is that when  the company asks for $10 million, the government could say, ""Well, we're not going to send that much"". But, again, we get back to the problem of a symmetric information. Sometimes, companies really do experience unexpected increases in cost. And if the government doesn't send the money when the company's costs go up, the company doesn't have enough money, and, over time, the company will have to decrease levels of service quality. Regulated private water utility's  encounter similar problems.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jwleEv0MYQ
Water and asymmetric information,"Under most of these regulatory schemes, it's set up so that if the costs of  the company go up, at least in the medium or long run, the company is allowed to charge  a higher price to water users. So, what of course is the incentive  of the private company? The incentive for the company is  to report to the government regulator all the time that its costs are going up. If there's a symmetric information, the government doesn't know  if the costs actually have gone up. If the costs haven't gone up, and the company reports that  the costs have gone up, and the government lets them raise their price, again, over time they'll keep on reporting that their costs have gone up and price will continue to rise.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jwleEv0MYQ
Water and asymmetric information,"Alternatively, maybe the government  regulator doesn't believe the company. The company reports that its costs have gone up and, sometimes, of course that's true. And if the government doesn't allow a higher price for water users, we're again back to the case where the quality of water services will decline. And again, all of these problems are due to a symmetric information, one key idea in micro economic theory.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jwleEv0MYQ
Water supply and demand,"I'm going to do some supply  and demand analysis for water, water subsidies,  and water price controls. This is also going to use a few graphs. Let's start by drawing a supply  and demand graph for water. On the vertical axis, we have P which means price, and on the horizontal axis, we have Q which means quantity. There's a supply curve  which slopes upwards.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7GvXh-A9VE
Water supply and demand,"That means that, at higher prices, people are more willing to sell water. There's a demand curve  which slopes downwards and that means, at higher prices,  people don't buy as much water. We have a point of market clearing which you can see here. It means, in this equilibrium, there's a market price  given on the vertical axis and there's a quantity bought and  sold given on the horizontal axis. In a very basic setting, there are some efficiency properties to this market price and market quantity.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7GvXh-A9VE
Water supply and demand,"For instance, assume that the production of water were to be extended to the right along this diagram  past the point of market equilibrium. So, rather than producing water here, we would be producing water, say, somewhere out here. What would then be the case. If you look at the point on the demand curve, that tells you how much is  the value of water to the demanders. If you look at the point  on the supply curve, that tells you how much  it's costing to supply that water.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7GvXh-A9VE
Water supply and demand,"And to be producing water  out here to the right, it would imply that it's costing more  to supply that water than people value that water,  and that would be inefficient. It means we're using too much water and we're using up water too rapidly. We would rather be back here  at the point of market clearing. Now, enter the water subsidy. A lot of governments  make it artificially cheap for individuals in  that country to use water.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7GvXh-A9VE
Water supply and demand,"The water subsidy may  apply directly to water but, sometimes,  the water subsidy is indirect and it takes the form  of a subsidy to agriculture. In a typical country, agriculture will  consume 60 to 80 % of the water needs. So, if agriculture is being subsidized, that means that indirectly  water is being subsidized too. For the water subsidy, let's go back  to our supply and demand curves. Price on the vertical axis,  quantity on horizontal.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7GvXh-A9VE
Water supply and demand,"The supply curve slopes up,  the demand curve slopes down. How we graph this depends on  the exact form the subsidy takes. But one simple way to think about it is to imagine that the subsidy shifts  the demand curve out and to the right. That means that,  at any given market price, people wish to buy more water because their purchase is  being subsidized by the government. We move from a state of affairs where people were  buying this much water to a state of affairs where  they're now buying this much water.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7GvXh-A9VE
Water supply and demand,"But they're actually buying too much water and we can represent  that quantity difference below. The demand curve which is further out to the right; it does represent higher demand for water, but it doesn't represent higher  social value for that water. The demand is higher only because  people are getting the subsidy, and that subsidy, of course, is taken away from others somewhere along the line. So, the real social value of water  is given by this initial demand curve. The social cost of the subsidy  is given by this triangle here, and economists call that dead-weight loss.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7GvXh-A9VE
Water supply and demand,"It represents the fact that,  after the subsidy, people are buying the water with  an artificially inflated demand curve which is not reflecting true social values. If you think of all of these points here, what we're seeing is that the social cost of those additional units of water is higher than the actual social value. So, again, too much water is  being put on the marketplace and water resources are  being used up too rapidly. The subsidy makes the private  value of buying the water higher than the social value  of supplying the water. In the developing world,  often, water use is not metered.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7GvXh-A9VE
Water supply and demand,"This means that at the margin  you can use more water and you don't have to pay for it. In terms of the demand,  this will make the demand very high. But in terms of willingness to supply, well, the businesses who  supply water; since they can't charge more for supplying extra, they're not so keen to supply more. This will bring about a problem. Let's go back to our supply  and demand graph.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7GvXh-A9VE
Water supply and demand,"Again, we have price on the vertical axis, quantity on the horizontal axis, a downward sloping demand curve, and upward sloping supply curve. And now, if there are no meters in essence at the margin, what's the price of water? It's going to be zero. Supply will be here, demand will be here. There's a big gap between how  much people want to buy of water and how much water will be supplied.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7GvXh-A9VE
Water supply and demand,"And that is the size of a water shortage. And that all comes about because at the margin, water is not being priced because in this case, there are no water meters. There are other forms  of water price controls. Imagine, for instance,  there's simply a law saying that water cannot be sold for any more  than this price we can then draw across. The quantity of water  supplied is this amount, the quantity of water  demanded is this amount.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7GvXh-A9VE
Water supply and demand,"And, again, we have a shortage of water given by the difference between desired quantity demanded and the quantity of water which suppliers are willing to put on the market. There's another interesting feature of these kinds of outcomes. When the price is too low, there are more people wanting to buy water than there will be water supplied. So, that water somehow has  to be rationed or allocated. Often, it's allocated  in terms of political privilege; who has the pull with the government  to get the permits, or the licenses, or the access to water.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7GvXh-A9VE
Water supply and demand,"In a market setting, the people who get that water are the people willing to pay the most for it, or the people who, in economic terms, value that water the most. When there's a price control, this means that who gets the water  has more to do with politics and it may or may not be the people  who actually value the water most in economic terms. This is a potential inefficiency, namely, that the people  who are getting the water are not the people who value  the water most in economic terms. This is one reason why economists  typically favor tradable water rights. Let's say we're in a situation where  the people who are getting the water through whatever mechanism are not  the people who value the water most in economic terms.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7GvXh-A9VE
Water supply and demand,"If those water rights are tradable, the people who get the water  will trade that water and those water rights to people  who value the water more. That will make the outcome, again  in economic terms, more efficient. When the water rights are not tradable, we are stuck with the people  owning or using the water being the people who are not  those who value the water most. To sum up, these are some basic settings  in which markets for water, prices for water, and  the trading of water rights help bring about more efficient outcomes. This analysis does not take into account  all of the complexities of water markets or all of their social ramifications, but think of it as  a very basic starting point for understanding some of the things which can go wrong in regulated water markets.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7GvXh-A9VE
Water supply and demand,Subsidies can cause excess water use and price controls can cause  inadequate water supply.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7GvXh-A9VE
"Wheat, water, and Saudi Arabia","This is a short tale about individuals who reject the ideas of comparative advantage and benefits from international trade. In the 1970s, Saudi Arabia ended up  as a much wealthier country in large part because the price  of oil had gone up so much. The Saudis then set out and decided  that they were going to grow more food. Now, upon reflection,  Saudi Arabia is not naturally a low-cost country for growing most foodstuffs. The kingdom of Saudi Arabia essentially has no lakes or rivers to speak of, and only a small part of the country gets enough natural rainfall to grow food.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjr-nurFLXo
"Wheat, water, and Saudi Arabia","So, for the most part, a decision  to grow more food in Saudi Arabia meant a decision to  subsidize water irrigation. In particular, the Saudi set out to grow more wheat. Over the years 1980 to 1992, they expanded their wheat  production by a factor of 29. Saudi Arabia became the sixth largest wheat exporter in the world they were even exporting  wheat to the Soviet Union. How did such a dry country manage this?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjr-nurFLXo
"Wheat, water, and Saudi Arabia","Well they did it by massive  subsidies to wheat growing and massive subsidies to  water irrigation for wheat. So, in Saudi Arabia, wheat production  would cost around $500 a ton when the market price was,  at the same time, about $120 a ton. By growing their own wheat, the Saudis were making it almost five times more expensive. The Saudis also wasted a lot of water. To grow all this wheat it required  300 billion cubic meters of water, most of it non-renewable.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjr-nurFLXo
"Wheat, water, and Saudi Arabia","To put that in perspective, that's about  equal to 6 years flow of water of the Nile river into Egypt. Over time however, the Saudis decided they simply couldn't afford  all of these expenses and in the year 2008 they decided to essentially give up on their wheat growing program with the goal that wheat  production in Saudi Arabia would essentially be gone by 2016. It's already the case that there are plenty of wheat farms out there in Saudi Arabia where the equipment is sitting there unused, simply gathering rust. In this case, it would have been  much cheaper for the Saudis to have relied on international  trade from the very beginning. The Saudis made this mistake of  starting to grow weed in the first place in part because they thought they  could achieve national self-sufficiency, in part because they could show the population that they were somehow  modernizing as a nation, in part because they've simply got carried away from having so much surplus cash, and also because subsidizing wheat  was a way of handing out goodies to a growing farm lobby.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjr-nurFLXo

Virtual water,"The concept of virtual water refers to the practice of trading commodities which themselves contain water. It's not always easy to trade water from one country to another. For one thing, the water itself may be difficult to transport  in large quantities. Furthermore, there may  be political obstacles when one country sells  its water supply to another country. Domestic citizens don't always like that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOJws1WznJI
Virtual water,"But then think about wheat. Wheat contains water. For instance, it can be that up to  1300 liters of water go into growing a kilogram of wheat. So, if one country is trading wheat to another country, in essence, that country  is also trading water. In the Middle East, some countries have much more water than others.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOJws1WznJI
Virtual water,"For instance, Lebanon is a relatively water rich country by the standards of the region. So ideally, Lebanon could be trading  more of its water resources to other Middle Eastern countries  in the form of agricultural products. This doesn't always happen, of course, because there is not free trade in the region and many countries in the region  prefer to be self-sufficient. Of course, this desire for  self-sufficiency is usually backed very strongly by the domestic agricultural lobbies. The bottom line is this.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOJws1WznJI

The Effect of Geography on Institutions,"In earlier videos, we explained how geography  can influence GDP per capita working through things like disease. We also explained that geography alone can't be everything, because institutions are also  clearly very, very important. What we want to do today is say how geography may have an indirect effect by changing or influencing institutions. Let's go. So, I'm going to focus in particular on why North America developed differently than Central and South America.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sLmXroN2sQ
The Effect of Geography on Institutions,"And the basic story is going to be this. At the beginning, Central and South America did very well because they had a lot of Geographic elements, factor endowments, in their favor, -- particularly, excellent places  to produce sugar and silver, and that made these places rich. However, in order to produce sugar and silver, -- it required them  to build up institutions -- which later on, particularly in the 19th and the 20th century, retarded development. So, these institutions which  were born in the early period, the sugar and the silver period, -- later on, retarded development and slowed down -- all of the things which created  a rich country in the modern world. I'm going to be basing a lot of what I say on Engerman and Sokoloff, an excellent paper called ""Factor Endowments, Inequality  and Paths of Development among New World Economies"".",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sLmXroN2sQ
The Effect of Geography on Institutions,"Let's begin with sugar. So, the West Indies and much of South and Central America had great climates for sugar, also for coffee, tobacco, cotton, -- and a lot of these places also had  very productive gold and silver mines. Now, what unites all of these activities is they involve large economies of scale. Sugar, for example, has never been produced on small family farms or sole proprietorships. When sugar is produced, it's produced on large plantations, -- using a lot of low-skilled, often slave labor.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sLmXroN2sQ
The Effect of Geography on Institutions,"It's back-breaking hard, hard labor. Hierarchical production. One guy at the top. A lot of low-skill, hard  slave labor at the bottom. Now, just to give a hint of where we're going.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sLmXroN2sQ
The Effect of Geography on Institutions,"Think about what a society born with this kind of picture that you see before you; what a society like this,  how it's going to develop. Here's another factor endowment: silver. In 1672, Potosi, which is in today's Bolivia, it was one of the largest and  wealthiest cities in the entire world, -- all because of this giant mountain  in the background which had huge deposits of silver. These deposits were mined by  African, native Indian slaves, -- and low-skilled, low-wage laborers. And these laborers were said  to have survived on average in these mines for less than a year.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sLmXroN2sQ
The Effect of Geography on Institutions,"Over the centuries, as many as 8 million men may have died from mining accidents, from lung disease, and from mercury poisoning which was used to process  and produce the silver. So, this was large-scale, industrial, hierarchical institutions based upon low-skilled, low-wage labor. It was extractive institutions, literally. Extracting the silver and also  extracting the lives from the workers. Today, by the way, Potosi is -- a poor region, a poor city  in a poor country.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sLmXroN2sQ
The Effect of Geography on Institutions,"A lot has changed. So, what does this tell you  about development? That's where we're moving to. Another factor endowment, at least when it came to the Europeans, frankly was people, -- not their human capital but simply people as slaves. So, many of the regions in the West Indies, in Central and South America  had these large native populations.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sLmXroN2sQ
The Effect of Geography on Institutions,"And European colonists, looking here, said, ""Hey, these populations are going to be great for forced labor"". In regions where there was resources, you know, like silver but no labor, that's where the African slaves  were imported in the millions. It's important to remember that  St. Martinique, which is a tiny island, -- this island imported  more slaves in its history than all of the United States -- mainly because the slaves came in, they were worked to death  and then regularly replaced. We think about slavery as being a US institution, but, much more so, it was a Central and  South American institution. When the Europeans came, at this point in time, -- in the 1500s, 1600s, 1700s -- they came to this region  not to live, but to rule.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sLmXroN2sQ
The Effect of Geography on Institutions,"So, we think today about Latin America as having a European character, -- but, as late as 1825, less than 25% of the population of Brazil was white. 55% was black, 21% was Indian. Even fewer were white in Spanish America. This idea of Latin America as having this European character, this only developed actually  much later in the 19th century. So, one factor endowment was the access to slave labor.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sLmXroN2sQ
The Effect of Geography on Institutions,"Now, let's compare the factor endowments of Central and South America, the 3 S's: slaves, silver, and sugar, -- with the factor endowments of North America. Let's begin with crops. So, the crops produced in much of North America, grains like wheat, had low economies of scale. What this meant was -- is that a farmer and his family  could make a living working for themselves  in North America, growing wheat. The same family could not produce sugar in Brazil.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sLmXroN2sQ
The Effect of Geography on Institutions,"For that, it took a firm, a large  body of labor and overseers; this capitalist production process. But you could have family farms in North America and indeed there were millions  of these family farmers. Jefferson went so far as to say that the yeoman farmer -- was the bedrock of US civilization. And, to one extent, he was right. The yeoman farmer was independent.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sLmXroN2sQ
The Effect of Geography on Institutions,"The yeoman farmer could not be -- buckled by the aristocrats. The yeoman farmer demanded equality. This is important to remember, because the aristocrats in North America; they wanted to set up  a more feudal society. They wanted to create the same society  as they were used to in Europe. But, in North America, they could not.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sLmXroN2sQ
The Effect of Geography on Institutions,"They could not, because, when they tried to do this, when the aristocrats tried  to create this feudal society, workers could say,  ""Take this job and shove it"". They could go west,  they could become a homesteader, they could get cheap land, they could become independent. And that possibility of being independent -- led the United States on a different growth path -- than Central and South America. Here's another factor endowment: people or, rather, lack of them. Compared to Central and South America, there were actually relatively  few natives in North America, -- and slaves, although incredibly  important for the United States, they never made up  a large share of the population, -- again, compared to South America and the Indies.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sLmXroN2sQ
The Effect of Geography on Institutions,"So, in 1820 for example, 80% of North America was white, -- less than 20% black; just almost the reverse  of Spanish America. So, this meant that North America, despite inequalities, particularly were the slaves, of course; it began with much more equality -- while South America began with hierarchy. Moreover, the fact that there were relatively few natives in North America, -- and you also didn't have the silver mines and this sugar production. This meant that the people  who came to North America; -- they were not the aristocrats of the day. The people who came to North America; they wanted to come here to live, not to rule, -- and they wanted to come here to be left alone.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sLmXroN2sQ
The Effect of Geography on Institutions,"They were the weirdos of the day, the religious nuts of the day, the people who were trying to get away with everything which had  oppressed them in Europe. These were the people  who came to America -- rather than the -- gung ho type, looking to make a buck, -- who went to Central and South America. So, the idea here is that the economies of scale, -- in sugar and mining, -- and the high demand for low-skilled labor -- meant that the South American colonies, including Central America and the West Indies, -- set up highly unequal societies. You had a few wealthy  European immigrants, -- often with very large land holdings, -- dominating large slave  and Indian populations. Now, Engerman and Sokoloff argued that these initial patterns of inequality -- persisted and were self-reinforcing throughout the 19th and 20th century -- to the detriment of economic growth.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sLmXroN2sQ
The Effect of Geography on Institutions,"That is, societies which  were born unequal -- were kept unequal. Let's look at literacy. So, these elites based upon  extractive institutions; -- this is a term from Acemoglu and Robinson's book, Why Nations Fail; -- they typically want a low-wage, low-education, low-skilled labor force, -- and they are willing to work  to keep the labor force that way, because a low-skilled labor force; it's complementary to land, to agriculture, and to simple mining production. So, the more low-skilled labor, the more the land owners would benefit. So, the landowners wanted to keep the population -- low-skilled, low-education.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sLmXroN2sQ
The Effect of Geography on Institutions,"A low-skilled, low-education, rural workforce is also easier to control. And you can see that the elites -- in Central and South America succeeded at this. So, here, our literacy rates, as late as 1900, -- in Guatemala, we're talking 11%, Bolivia 17%, Mexico 22%, Brazil 25%, and so forth. This compares with Canada, -- with the United States where you're talking 80 to 90% of the population is literate in 1900. Big differences.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sLmXroN2sQ
The Effect of Geography on Institutions,"And the difference is, the point we're making are not accidental. The differences were flowing from the nature of extractive institutions and from the incentives of these elite groups, -- these land-owning groups, -- to keep their rural workforce low-educated. Same story can be told here  with respect to democracy. So, as late as 1909, none of the countries in Latin America had the secret ballot. Wealth and literacy requirements remain common long after they had ended in North America.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sLmXroN2sQ
The Effect of Geography on Institutions,"In part, this is because, with a less literate population, -- you expect democracy to take a longer time to arrive, with a more rural population, you expect democracy  to take a longer time to arrive. It's also because the elites may have feared democracy, -- and, in a way, they were probably right to do so. So, think about, again, the inequality in land holding. Now, the thing about land; it's very easy to redistribute. It's hard to hide land,  the supply is fixed -- unlike income based on human capital, and you can take it from one person and give it to another.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sLmXroN2sQ
The Effect of Geography on Institutions,"It's harder to do that with  human capital, because -- if you start taking too much  of the income of human capital, the people won't accumulate  human capital any longer. So, the elites, -- when the elites are based upon the land, they may have more to fear  from democracy, and, thus, suppress democracy a lot more than in North America. And the elites were  successful at doing this. So, let's think about the distribution of lands circa 1900. So, in Mexico in 1910, less than 5% of rural  household heads owned land, -- very much coming all the way down from the 1500s and 1600s.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sLmXroN2sQ
The Effect of Geography on Institutions,"In Argentina, about 20%. Again, compared to the United States, about 80%, in 1900, of rural households owned land. In Canada, it was 90%. Even today, hundreds of years after the colonial period, -- we still see a massive level of income inequality in these countries. So, in Haiti, -- this Gini index, which is a measure of inequality, -- is at a really high, 60, Brazil, 54, Bolivia, 57, -- Colombia, 58, Guatemala, 54.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sLmXroN2sQ
The Effect of Geography on Institutions,"These are some of the most  unequal countries in the world. The United States, which is actually one of the most unequal developed countries, in comparison, is quite a bit less, 41, -- Canada, down here, at 33. Now, all of this inequality, and suppression of education, and so forth -- would not have mattered so much, except for the fact -- that, when we get to  the Industrial Revolution, in particular in  the 19th and 20th centuries, -- what is driving growth is ideas. It's human capital. It's innovation, productivity, technology, and so forth.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sLmXroN2sQ
The Effect of Geography on Institutions,"And countries with a lot of inequality had trouble developing along this path. So, just think about Edison. You know, he is -- does not come from the elite, -- he is not well educated, -- and, yet, it's because of Edison and people like him -- that we get all of these patents, all of these new ideas. The light bulb, the very symbol of ideas, coming from this -- less-educated, non-elite person. That shows you the importance of using all of your brain power.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sLmXroN2sQ
The Effect of Geography on Institutions,"And these countries, which had  the this massive inequality, -- where the elites didn't want  to take advantage of that brain power, they feared the brainpower of the masses. These countries had trouble growing. An extractive institutions; they can only extract  so much before they collapse. So, we talked earlier about Potosi, -- then one of the richest countries in the world, one of the richest cities in the world in 1672. Today, it's dirt poor.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sLmXroN2sQ
The Effect of Geography on Institutions,"People are still trying to mine, scrape whatever silver they can  out of those mines. But it has a terrible working conditions, terrible standard of living. Bolivia, one of the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere. Okay. Let's summarize the argument.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sLmXroN2sQ
The Effect of Geography on Institutions,"So, we begin with factor endowments. In South America, that was sugar, silver, slaves. And these factor endowments pushed the economy towards these extractive  economic institutions. Economies of scale using a lot of low-wage, low-skilled, often, slave labor. These extractive economic institutions created extractive political institutions, -- that is, the suppression of democracy, the creation of oligarchies, and so forth.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sLmXroN2sQ
The Effect of Geography on Institutions,"Elites. Then, these elites choose to maintain their power. They choose policies to maintain their power, to keep those workers low-skilled, to keep them low-education. And remember, when you're at the top, -- when you have a political system which is dominated by people at the top, -- these people; they don't want creative destruction, -- that's likely to destroy them. They don't want anti-innovation, they don't want innovation rather, they're anti-innovation, because when you're already  rich and powerful, -- innovation is primarily  a threat to your position.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sLmXroN2sQ
The Effect of Geography on Institutions,"So, you pass policies which suppress technology, which suppress entrepreneurship, which suppress creative destruction. You want to keep instead your laborers low-skilled, low-education, make your rents from that land. So, these elites choose the policies to maintain power. This further supports these extractive economic institutions which support the extractive political institutions and so forth. Now, by the way, -- we started the story off  with factor endowments, but in different places, in different parts of the world, at different times of history.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sLmXroN2sQ
The Effect of Geography on Institutions,"We could equally well have started  the story with differences in history, or even with differences  in random events, chance events. The point here is that small factors, fairly small factors; once they start you going on this circle, the circle becomes very  difficult to break out of. That's why it's a vicious circle. That is why it can take hundreds of years, once this circle has begun, -- once these institutions  have been put into place, -- it can take hundreds of years  to break out of this circle, even when breaking out of the circle  would ultimately be to the benefit, to the great benefit, of  the mass of the population. Thank you very much.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sLmXroN2sQ
Jeffrey Sachs (Optional),"now let's turn to Jeffrey Sachs perhaps the most famous living development economist. Sachs has had a wide-ranging career which is in some ways tracked the course of world events. It spanned both development practice and research into development economics. He spent most of his career by the way at Harvard University and later at Columbia. Sachs is pretty well known to the general public, in part because he spent time associating with various movie stars and rock stars, so Jeff Sachs really is the Economist as celebrity himself.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXz44gVCL8U
Jeffrey Sachs (Optional),"But we're going to look at another angle of his work, namely his impact on the theory and practice of economic development. But if you were thinking hmm Sachs isn't that the guy I saw with Angelina Jolie? well that's probably right! Sachs first made his name as an economist in the early 1980s. He wrote a series of papers on international trade exchange rates and international policy coordination and in the 80s he became tenured at harvard as one of the youngest full professors at Harvard ever.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXz44gVCL8U
Jeffrey Sachs (Optional),"If you're interested in reading Sach's on international trade there's a good synthetic 1995 paper he did, which is online it's called economic reform and the process of global integration. In that paper he talks about how the opening up of economies to trade is really is a prerequisite and driver of further policy reform, but although this work on international trade had a real impact it's actually not what Sachs is best known for today. Sachs moved more into the public eye in the mid-1980s, with the Bolivian reforms especially the reforms against hyperinflation in 1985 the government of Bolivia asked Sachs if you would come down and help them with their economy and he came up with a comprehensive fairly drastic plan for ending their hyperinflation and reforming their economy. By no means did this plan fix all or even most of their problems but it did help the Bolivians end the hyperinflation, and overall it can be judged a success. It was a form of what later came to be called shock therapy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXz44gVCL8U
Jeffrey Sachs (Optional),"Plans of this sort where based on tight controls over the money supply, freeing up prices, and liberalizing the economy. Sachs' connection to this so-called shock therapy continued, and indeed it intensified as Eastern Europe started to throw off communism in the late 1980s. At that point it was then necessary to have plans for reform, Sachs visited Poland and he was very important there as an advisor and it's an advisor for dismantling the communist system and moving to our to market economy. Again Sach's recipes were often fairly drastic, namely the sense that an economy could and indeed should do a lot of things upfront very quickly to reestablish a market economy right away. With the passage of time I would judge shock therapy in Poland actually to have been quite a success.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXz44gVCL8U
Jeffrey Sachs (Optional),Lately Poland has been growing rapidly and it really has joined the community of Western European nations as a more or less equal partner. In Russia the use of shock therapy was more controversial because it was accompanied by a series of privatizations which led to a lot of corruption and redistributed wealth in a manner which many people consider unjust. In fairness to Sachs these privatizations in Russia happened after he left the country and stopped serving there as an advisor. Nonetheless the important point here is that shock therapy remains a somewhat controversial concept. By the way if you'd like to read sacks on shock therapy I recommend this piece which is available online.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXz44gVCL8U
Jeffrey Sachs (Optional),"In any case you can already see that Sachs has been extremely important as a practitioner of the science and art of economic development. Moving back to economic theory and research, Sachs has had an important piece on what is called the natural resource curse it resurrected the notion that possibly countries could experience growth problems precisely because they had natural resources, that this natural resource might make the country more corrupt or it might make them rely too much on those natural resources. We consider this argument in more detail in our video unit on the natural resource curse, so I would refer you to that. Needless to say Sachs made important contributions solutions in this area, and he brought up a new what had been in old and at the time somewhat abandoned debate. Sachs has been an important researcher on African economic growth, and Why it has chronically been so slow, Sachs attributes many of Africa's economic problems to its unique geography, a lower productivity of the soil, greater problems with rainfall, and also demography, Africa has an especially high youth dependency ratio that is a lot of young people who need to be supported.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXz44gVCL8U
Jeffrey Sachs (Optional),"And Africa has many more infectious diseases which need to be worried about when you put all these factors together according to Sachs Africa faces really some very special burdens in attempting to achieve economic growth. In particular Sachs co-authored a piece called the economic burden of malaria, which looked closely at just how much malaria held back the economies of Africa. The problem of malaria is not only that it kills people, but also when you are young if you're infected by malaria it stunts your physical growth, it may stunt your brain growth, and it can lead to long-lasting and persistent problems. The importance of infectious disease has been a recurring theme of sach's work on Africa. For a summary of a lot of sach's thought on this topic I would refer you to his piece, ""Institutions don't rule"", and also Alex's video on geography development disease which talks about Sachs' ideas here at much greater length.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXz44gVCL8U
Jeffrey Sachs (Optional),"More recently Sachs has been at the forefront of the millennium villages project in Africa, which is being done jointly with the Earth Institute at Columbia, and also the United Nations. The idea here is really quite ambitious, that a sufficiently comprehensive program of foreign aid can help targeted villages escape a poverty trap and blossom into economic development. This is occasioned a lot of debate and we have an entire video just on the millennium villages project, and so I'll refer you to that. Needless to say ,this project has captured a lot of media attention and right now it's the single biggest project which Sachs is most closely identified with. Sachs has done so many different things of importance in development economics, and I've tried to offer references to each as we've been going along.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXz44gVCL8U
Jeffrey Sachs (Optional),"I also apologize too many of Sachs co-authors, we just haven't had time to mention them all. Sachs also has numerous books if you're going to read just one, I think the best one is an introduction to his thought . It's the one called the end of poverty in any case there's plenty of Sachs available online and free. Keep in mind that what's really special about Sachs is a development economist is this dual role as advisor / practitioner and researcher.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXz44gVCL8U
Trust and economic growth,"Hello, this is Tyler Cowen. Let's consider today the role of trust in supporting and promoting economic growth. Economics suggests that societies with higher levels of trust should also be wealthier and have higher levels of economic growth. Think about it. Every time  you trade with someone, typically, that trade involves  some measure of trust.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wXy12FQPD8
Trust and economic growth,"You trust that the goods and services you are receiving will be worthwhile, or that you trust the supplier will still be in business, say, a year from now, in case you have some kind of problem. When trust is high, cooperation tends to be high. It tends to be higher in the workplace. This makes businesses more efficient, and it makes it easier  to build large businesses. When trust is high, you don't have to spend all of your resources protecting property rights.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wXy12FQPD8
Trust and economic growth,"To some extent, you are trusting other people to not simply come along and take what you have. When trust is high, corruption tends to be lower, you can rely more upon the quality of public sector officials and public services. Also, capital markets should work better when trust is high, because borrowing and lending  will be easier and less costly, because people in general will expect others to be paying them back. Let's look at a specific empirical article on the connection between trust and growth. This is written by Paul Zak and Stephen Knack.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wXy12FQPD8
Trust and economic growth,"This paper, and a lot of the other research in the area, draws upon something called 'The World Value Survey. ' This took place in many different countries. Basically, the researchers went around and they spoke to people, and they asked them what they thought of these two statements. First: 'Most people can be trusted,' versus, 'You can't be too careful in dealing with people. ' As you would expect,  the more trusting countries are more likely to support the response 'Most people can be trusted.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wXy12FQPD8
Trust and economic growth,"' The country which comes out highest on the trust scale is Norway, a very wealthy country and, also, a very cooperative country where rates of crime are quite low. The country of Cape Verde pulls in the lowest score, but it would be a mistake to conclude that Cape Verde is the least trustworthy country in the world or even close to it. A lot of countries simply aren't surveyed because it's too violent there and there's simply not a high enough level of trust for a stranger to be going around asking people, 'How much do you trust others? ' In any case, Knack and Zak take this data set and they perform some statistics on it. They do what are called  'cross-country growth regressions.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wXy12FQPD8
Trust and economic growth,"' On the left-hand side of the statistical equation is a country's growth rate. That's what we're trying to explain. On the right-hand side, we put a number of variables that might contribute to explaining that growth rate. In this paper, these variables include schooling, investment, the starting point of a country  in terms of per capita income, and also religion. Of course, these are not the only possibilities.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wXy12FQPD8
Trust and economic growth,"The authors ran a much greater number of possibilities for variables on the right-hand side. But the key thing we want to see is that when we put in some plausible variables on the right-hand side, is the variable for trust going to make a difference for the growth rate? In fact, in the paper, it turns out that trust really does make a difference. What Zak and Knack find is growth rises by, nearly, one percentage point on average for each 15 percentage point increase in trust. To make this a little more concrete, if the nation of Panama had about as much trust in it  as the nation of Austria, according to their results, in Panama, economic growth would be about one percentage point higher.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wXy12FQPD8
Trust and economic growth,"If you'd like to see the relationship  between trust and economic growth rates in the form of a picture,  here's Figure 1 in their paper. You can see also that the country  with the highest level of trust, it's out here, it's Norway. The country with the highest level of economic growth is South Korea. And, again, in this picture you're seeing a positive relationship between trust and economic growth plotted in this graph. You might wonder in this paper,  'What is it that is determining trust?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wXy12FQPD8
Trust and economic growth,"' In their data set, they find trust is positively correlated with both formal and informal institutions, and, also, positively correlated with wages. That makes good intuitive sense. Trust decreases with population heterogeneity and, somewhat oddly, trust goes down somewhat with increases in wealth. Other research has found that, very often, trust is inherited from the culture of one's forefathers. That is, if your ancestors  came, say, from Norway and you are Norwegian American, your degree of trusting this  is likely to be correlated with the level of trust in Norway.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wXy12FQPD8
Trust and economic growth,"In other words, trust somehow  persists in a culture and it's something you pick up,  in part, from your parents even if you're living in a different country altogether. You might also wonder, 'What are the channels of trust? ' That is, how does trust actually operate to increase the growth rate  and bring about prosperity? It's not automatic. You don't simply wake up one day, and you trust each other, and then more wealth falls out of the sky.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wXy12FQPD8
Trust and economic growth,How does it work? There's a good paper on this topic. 'How does social trust affect economic growth? ' You can google that online. This paper finds two major channels for how trust boosts economic growth.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wXy12FQPD8
Trust and economic growth,"The first is through quality of governance in the rule of law. That is, the more trusting societies have governments which work better and they're more likely to apply  their laws in a fair and just manner, and that will boost economic productivity and wealth. Another channel for how trust boosts the growth rate is through schooling. Societies with higher levels of trust invest more in schooling. This raises the value of human capital and productivity, and it boosts the growth rate.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wXy12FQPD8
Trust and economic growth,"I would stress that, throughout the videos in the series, we see numerous examples of just how much trust matters and how and why trust matters. Trust seems to matter for better outcomes in education, better outcomes in health care,  better outcomes in water policy, and lower levels of corruption. All of these will boost economic growth. So, the evidence that trust matters, it comes in part from these macroeconomic studies as we've looked at. But it will also come from a lot of very finely grained, small-scale micro-investigations, which you'll be seeing more of as we proceed.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wXy12FQPD8

"The Solow Model (Brief, no math)","Let's talk about economist Robert Solow, and his contributions to the theory of economic growth. You may have seen that Alex has several excellent videos on the Solow model, but those use a fair amount of mathematics, so if you're not comfortable with that math, here's a simpler and shorter version. It's not as thorough as Alex's treatment, but you can think of it as a very basic introduction or overview of Solow. By the way, this is Robert Solow, here pictured. He won a Nobel prize in 1987, and most of his career, he spent teaching at MIT.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOsmFF4NGek
"The Solow Model (Brief, no math)","One important feature of the Solow model is that it took economic growth, and it broke it down very carefully into underlying categories. So in simplest terms, you can think of the Solow model as suggesting that economic growth comes from capital, it comes from labor, and it comes from ideas or new technology, and part of the point of the model is just to help us figure out for any particular episode of economic growth, how much of that growth  came from adding more capital inputs, how much of that growth came from more people working or people working longer hours, and how much of that growth came from innovation? That sounds pretty simple, but until the Solow model in the mid-1950s, it had actually never been done properly before. In the context of developing nations, it's important to note that quite often, a lot of the growth comes from adding inputs of capital and adding inputs of labor and very often, not so much of it is from ideas or new technology. You can think of it this way: imagine a developing economy, and a lot of people are moving in from the countryside, they're moving to cities, and as they move to cities and start working in factories, they're a lot more productive.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOsmFF4NGek
"The Solow Model (Brief, no math)","That causes economic growth. It's a way of thinking about the sources of the growth, but it also implies there may in the future be a potential limit to that growth because once all the available people have moved from the countryside to the city, well, that additional labor as a source of growth has somewhat dried out. Developing economies then often need to make a transition from just relying on growth from capital and labor to relying on growth from more ideas and new technology, and of course that's often not a very easy transition to make. By the way, that growth from ideas and new technology, in the literature, sometimes, it is called the Solow residual. Solow residual.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOsmFF4NGek
"The Solow Model (Brief, no math)","Another key feature of the Solow model it is what is sometimes called catch-up growth. Catch-up growth occurs when there's say,  a rich country and a poor country, and the poor country is growing at a faster rate than is the rich country. You can think of the poor country as in some way catching up to the rich country, precisely because the poor country is lacking so many important things, the rate of return on investing capital in the poor country is especially high. So if you think of Japan and Germany after the end of World War 2, once they start rebuilding, they have higher growth rates than does the United States because they were doing that catch-up. They were rebuilding their factories, they were repairing roads, they were putting their cities back together again, and again, there was a very high rate of return on capital investment in those very important ventures.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOsmFF4NGek
"The Solow Model (Brief, no math)","You can also think of modern China as having been engaged in catch-up growth with the West. Once China got the institutions and incentives right to be growing at all, the marginal rate of return on investing capital in China was very high, and of course, China grew rapidly. I've already mentioned the  assumption of diminishing marginal returns to capital, but it's key to the Solow model. So let's look at it just a little more explicitly. If you think of the situation portrayed in this picture, here's a city, and someone needs to build a road to the city, maybe that's the first road you build and that road is of very high value.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOsmFF4NGek
"The Solow Model (Brief, no math)","So when the capital stock is low, when there aren't many roads, the first roads that you build are extremely valuable roads. That's that high marginal rate of return on capital, and in the Solow model, that tends to spur growth, it encourages capital accumulation, the road gets built, and it has very high value. Subsequent applications of capital don't have that same high  marginal value as, you know, building the big, important road to your major city. So you might build another road out in the countryside, pictured here. It would have some value.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOsmFF4NGek
"The Solow Model (Brief, no math)","People could go for Sunday drives on the road, but it's a lower marginal value than building that first important road to your big city. So this is diminishing marginal returns to capital. As economies get wealthier, they often experience diminishing marginal returns to capital, and that will mean their rate of economic growth is lower, as portrayed and explained in the Solow model. Because of catch-up growth, the Solow model does generally predict that there will be a convergence of living standards around the world because the poorer countries are playing catch-up to the richer countries, and if the poorer countries are growing at a faster rate. Well, at some point in time,  they will indeed catch up.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOsmFF4NGek
"The Solow Model (Brief, no math)","So if you look at all of the growth  in developing economies over the last 10 to 20 years, the Solow model is actually seen as explaining a pretty good piece of this growth. But still, there's an  important question. How much convergence really is there? There's some catch-up, but we don't by any means observe complete catch-up, and there seem to be a lot of  very poor countries which are not succeeding in catching up at all. In fact, the poorest of them may  be lagging behind.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOsmFF4NGek
"The Solow Model (Brief, no math)","So that's one feature of the world which really isn't explained by the Solow model. There's also something known as the middle income trap, and we have a separate video on that, but the middle-income trap comes about when growing economies, they get a lot of early quick growth just by throwing a lot of labor and capital inputs at a problem, but when the time comes for those same economies to become innovators when it's not easy for people to simply work any more hours because they're already working very hard, well, a lot of countries tend to get stuck at that level, and that again is a case where you have imperfect convergence. Those are some ways in which the Solow model, even though it's quite useful, it doesn't explain every  feature of our world. Finally, in the Solow model, it's quite an abstract set of numbers and equations. There is not an explicit consideration of institutions and incentives.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOsmFF4NGek
"The Solow Model (Brief, no math)","in the broader sense of thinking about what kind of social order does a place have, and how is it rewarding innovation, and is there corruption, and are property rights enforced, and all of these important questions, and those  in fact may go a long way toward helping us determine whether some countries will converge with the wealthy countries and maybe other countries will not. Again, those are some important features of the problem, which to study them, you need to go outside of the Solow model. Robert Solow is a very witty man, and he's known as such. He has a lot of famous sayings, and one of them shows that I think he really does believe in a good deal of convergence. Solow once said, and I quote, ""There is no evidence that God ever intended the United States of America to have a higher per capita income than the rest of the world for eternity"".",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOsmFF4NGek
"The Solow Model (Brief, no math)","The Solow model is a very important  place to start for understanding the nature and sources of economic growth. It's an incomplete model, but still it's a basic model that is really foundational for the thinking of economists on growth. I definitely recommend you give a try Alex's more complex videos, even if you don't understand all of what's in there, they have many very important points, but you also can just Google ""Robert Solow,"" ""Solow growth model,"" and ""Economic growth convergence"".",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOsmFF4NGek
The Middle Income Trap,"Now, let's talk about the so called middle income trap. The so called middle income trap refers to the fact that a lot of countries reach  a particular standard of living, broadly called middle income, but then they don't break through to being fully developed, fully wealthy countries. If you look at this graph here,  you can see that Japan has broken through and you can see that South Korea has broken through, Singapore and Taiwan. But most developing nations;  they reached a certain level, it's the group banded in here,  and then they more or less stick there. They grow slowly and they do not, as I said, fully develop.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uKYYQAgJDg
The Middle Income Trap,"There's a paper by Barry Eichengreen  and two co-authors; it runs some specific numbers. And what they find is that, by the time countries get to the general range of 17,000 $ a year income per capita, that their growth rate on average  is falling from 5.6 % to 2.1 % which is a pretty steep tumble. They also find this is especially likely for societies as they get older and countries which had driven  their earlier growth with an artificially low  real exchange rate. I don't think we have a good scientific  understanding of the middle income trap but there are a number of plausible  hypotheses for what exactly goes wrong. One possibility is simply as  the country becomes wealthier, its wages go up and it can no longer compete as simply being a place with a lot of cheap labor.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uKYYQAgJDg
The Middle Income Trap,"There's also the possibility  that labor migration runs dry. So, a lot of countries generate  a lot of economic growth just by sending people from  the quite unproductive countryside to relatively productive cities. It's simply a transfer of human resources, but this transfer cannot go on forever. It's harder to take people in cities  and make them much more productive than it is to simply ship people  from the countryside to the city. It's also the case that in these countries the demographics may slow, more people get older and there are fewer energetic young people entering the labor force.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uKYYQAgJDg
The Middle Income Trap,"Very important is that  it may be hard for countries to keep on moving up the value chain. So for instance, Mexico has gone  successfully from just growing tomatoes to growing tomatoes  and producing automobiles. But it would be much harder for Mexico to become the next innovator, say producing the next Google  or the next Facebook or inventing the design  for the next iPhone. In general, economic growth  as you get wealthier; it depends increasingly on innovation and innovation is much harder than simply copying what already developed  countries do but at lower wage levels. For all these reasons and possibly more, this may be motivating  the so-called middle income trap.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uKYYQAgJDg
The Middle Income Trap,"The United States is one country  which is continuing to grow. It may not be growing  at its previous peak rates, but it is growing somewhat and  innovating somewhat nonetheless. But we can see, by looking at  the United States, just how hard this is. How many pieces of the puzzle  have to fit together just right for notions such as the iPhone or Google or Facebook to have been possible. As mentioned before, some countries  have broken through the middle income trap such as Japan and South Korea.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uKYYQAgJDg
The Middle Income Trap,"And the way they have done it is  by a combination of factors, but they have continued to invest  in economic specialization, they have improved  their systems of education, they have worked at being innovators, they have moved to democracy, they have thick middle classes which demand decent results from their governments. And maybe, most importantly,  putting these all together, for a country to break through  the middle income trap, it has to be capable of producing large-scale institutions  at world-class levels. Very often, the middle income trap is discussed today in the context of China. Will China continue to grow  at outrageously high rates or will the Chinese economic miracle slow down considerably and China would then be caught  in the middle income trap. Of course there are economists  on both sides of this debate.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uKYYQAgJDg
The Middle Income Trap,"The China optimists say the country has a lot more building to do and a lot more people  it can make productive and that fundamentally the productive  institutions are on the right track. The pessimists point out that  a lot of Chinese institutions appear to be of relatively low quality and China has progressed a great deal  by copying production methods and by lowering their cost but that China is not really close  to being a major innovator. And if we refer back to the Barry Eichengreen paper, it seems China does  very much have two features which characterize those countries which tend to get stuck in middle-income traps, namely slowing demographics and having been a country which relied in the past on an artificially low real exchange rate for growth. This debate continues  and, of course, time will tell. To read more on the middle income trap, I recommend that you google  to these sources, which are all online.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uKYYQAgJDg

What Is the Rule of 70?,"âª [music] âª [Narrator] The Rule of 70 is a quick and easy method to tell you how fast something that is growing will double in size over time. It doesn't matter what is growing -- it could be your savings account, the world population, computing power, the number of bacteria in a petri dish, or a country's economy -- the Rule of 70 will allow you to impress your friends and confound your enemies by quickly estimating the doubling time. But what is the Rule of 70? If a variable is growing at a rate of x% per period, you can calculate how quickly it will double by taking 70 and dividing it by x, the growth rate. For example, suppose you have money in an investment account that has an annual rate of growth of 5% per year.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYSW8CaA-0w
What Is the Rule of 70?,"Your money will grow 5% in the first year, and then in the second year, you'll get compound interest. The 5% growth will be on the original amount plus the growth from the first year. Given this compounding growth, how fast will you double your money? Well, if you were to actually calculate this out, the math would look like this. The Rule of 70 is an approximation for this calculation.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYSW8CaA-0w
What Is the Rule of 70?,"In the case of our 5% growth rate, the Rule of 70 says the doubling time is 70 divided by 5, or 14 years. The exact calculation? 13.86 years. So, the Rule of 70 is pretty accurate. The Rule of 70 comes in very handy in all kinds of ways -- for example, when comparing how living standards are changing in various countries.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYSW8CaA-0w
What Is the Rule of 70?,"In growth miracles, like Korea, China, and Japan, we've seen annual growth rates of 7 to 10%. At 10% growth, that means living standards are doubling every seven years. China did this for 35 years. So, how much bigger is it 35 years later? If it doubles every 7 years for 35 years, then it doubled 5 times.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYSW8CaA-0w
What Is the Rule of 70?,"Doubling five times means you multiply the original size times 2, times 2, times 2, times 2, times 2 -- or, much easier to say,  you raise 2 to the 5th power. And that means GDP per capita in China is 32 times bigger than where it started 35 years before. The Rule of 70 lets you see the power of compounding without actually having to do the compounding. Now, with the Rule of 70, we can quickly compare China's growth rate to most developed countries that typically see only a 2% growth rate, which means only two times bigger in 35 years -- a dramatic difference from being 32 times bigger. The Rule of 70 can also be used in reverse.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYSW8CaA-0w
What Is the Rule of 70?,"If you know that house prices doubled between 2000 and 2006, for example, then you know that 70 divided by x equals 6 or that house prices increased at a rate of about 11.6% per year. The Rule of 70 gives us a handy tool to quickly approximate doubling time given that we know the annual growth rate. Check out our practice questions to test your skills on the Rule of 70.

Premature Deindustrialization,"âª [music] âª - [Tyler] Economic development is one of the central problems facing mankind, but how exactly is economic development supposed to come about? Well, there's an older model called ""export-oriented growth,"" but these days, many economists are worrying that export-oriented growth no longer can succeed. This is called the theory of premature deindustrialization -- mainly that emerging economies may not have the right mix of jobs for a continued growth. What exactly is this concept, and what are economists thinking about it? First, let's review what economic development looked like in the past, before turning back to that concept.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsAjHzAGZDU
Premature Deindustrialization,"When we look back to history, we find that most of today's wealthy countries had a significant portion of their overall employment in manufacturing jobs. The United States, for instance -- manufacturing jobs peaked in the 1970s, more than a quarter of the American workforce. In other developed countries today, manufacturing jobs have, at times in the past, been 30 or 40% of the workforce -- Sweden, Germany, Great Britain. Now, why is a manufacturing job so special, anyway? First, there's some good evidence that manufacturing jobs are often more productive; they have higher rates of productivity growth; they're more likely to occur in larger firms; and they're also more likely to be connected to exporting to a global market.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsAjHzAGZDU
Premature Deindustrialization,"It's easier to send a manufactured good abroad than it is to try to sell a person-to-person service to buyers in another country. And, furthermore, a nice feature of manufacturing jobs is it tends to breed corporate-interest groups, which want the government to build a lot of infrastructure and invest in a lot of human capital, and that tends to boost economic development more generally. A lot of manufacturing jobs -- like, say, being an autoworker in an automobile plant -- you work there for a long time, you need to build up some skills, so the employer invests a lot in training, makes sure those are good jobs, and wants quite a stable workforce. If you take a typical service-sector job -- say, like serving in a Starbucks -- well, the incentive for the boss to invest in the human capital of the workers, it's just not nearly as strong. So a large manufacturing sector allows a country to sell abroad which, in turn, expands its potential markets.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsAjHzAGZDU
Premature Deindustrialization,"That incentivizes investment in infrastructure and in human capital, and that leads to increased wages and the emergence of a country's middle class. And that, for many nations, has proven to be a successful model of economic growth. And we find this in the histories of South Korea and Japan -- building a lot of manufactured goods, and selling them abroad. It's sometimes called export-oriented growth. The difference today is that there's much more automation.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsAjHzAGZDU
Premature Deindustrialization,"A factory has gone from being a noisy place to being a very quiet place. Machines, computers, software, robots do most of the work. Here's a fact I find truly striking. Right now, the greatest number of robots in the world is in China, and China is a relatively low-wage economy. When even China is investing in robots -- this is a sign that exported manufacturers are not going to put so many people to work at middle-class wages in the future, that the number of jobs that will be created by exporting manufacturers is relatively limited.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsAjHzAGZDU
Premature Deindustrialization,"Those jobs will have to come somewhere else. So we find in countries such as Brazil, or India, or Mexico, or South Africa, the percentage of jobs in manufacturing -- that's been shrinking for some time. In those economies, the percentage of jobs in manufacturing is not exceeding 18%. They seem to have reached a peak manufacturing point. They are skipping this intermediate stage of having a lot of manufacturing jobs, never quite getting that middle class in place, not getting the same incentives to invest in human capital and infrastructure.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsAjHzAGZDU
Premature Deindustrialization,"How much is this a problem to worry about? Again, opinions differ somewhat. Economist Dani Rodrik is one thinker. He's quite worried about the loss of the manufacturing path toward growth. He stressed the point that not all jobs are created equally.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsAjHzAGZDU
Premature Deindustrialization,"I'm somewhat more optimistic. It could be that economic development paths of the future -- they're going to look, perhaps, very, very different than what we're used to. What are some of those possible paths? Well, one path would be to try to export a lot more service-sector jobs. Sometimes, in the United States, if you call up a Help Desk to help you with your electronics device, well, you may end up speaking to someone in the Philippines, or to India.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsAjHzAGZDU
Premature Deindustrialization,"So there are some exports of service-sector jobs, but it's notable that, so far, exporting service-sector jobs has not occurred on a scale nearly as large as previous exports of manufacturing jobs. It could be that a lot of the economic growth of the future that will drive development -- it will be internal, within nations, and not always based on exporting to wealthier countries. A good example of internal growth would be India. India, actually, has not had a lot of success exporting its manufactured goods. But what India has done well at is by taking ideas from other countries, and also doing its own innovations and generating more trade and more investment within India.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsAjHzAGZDU
Premature Deindustrialization,"That's why we call the growth internal. And the logic there of the gains from trade -- even though it's not always involving other nations, still, both parties are better off. Wealth is created, and, over time, those real wages will rise. Well, we also may be entering an era of consumer-driven growth. That is, a lot of the growth comes first by getting the consumer products, and then, over time, you figure out ways to use those consumer products to help drive your service-sector businesses.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsAjHzAGZDU
Premature Deindustrialization,"A simple example here -- our cell phones. If you go to African cities, or even now the African countryside, most people have cell phones. Cell phones have knit together many parts of Africa in a network of commerce. They've made it easier to trade goods. They help people use bank accounts and access means of payment.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsAjHzAGZDU
Premature Deindustrialization,"Economic growth in Africa has been a lot more rapid because of the cell phone. Or, imagine consumer drones. Consumer drones are coming on the market now. They're quite cheap. They can help you transport goods.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsAjHzAGZDU
Premature Deindustrialization,"You will have emerging economies being among the first places to use drones in an effective way -- say, by sending medicines to a remote area when people need help. This is sometimes called a consumption-led model of growth -- the people get very, very cheap consumer goods, but they use those consumer goods to help them run businesses in a more productive way. So this means that the economic development of the future may look quite different from the economic development of the past. The physical buildings may not impress you as much, but the smarts, the networking, and the mobilization of information might be a new kind of invisible, yet very powerful form of economic development. But the takeaways here are -- New patterns of growth are not like the old ones.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsAjHzAGZDU
Premature Deindustrialization,"Something fundamentally has shifted in manufacturing. That's mostly because of automation. Export-oriented growth of the kind that South Korea and Japan did -- that may well be a thing of the past. But there are also new and dynamic opportunities for service-sector growth, internal growth, pulling new ideas off the shelf more quickly, and consumer-led growth with products such as cell phones and drones. Just pull out your cell phone and think about the power of that device.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsAjHzAGZDU

"Purchasing Power Parity: When in India, Get a Haircut","Raju is just as good a barber as any in the United States, but he earns a lot less. Raju might like to come to the United States and sell his labor for $10 an hour instead of the $10 a day or less that he earns here in India. But labor is immobile. A host of laws prevent him from moving. As a result, the price of labor can be very different across the world, and that means the price of services that are immobile -- not just haircuts, but also housecleaning, taxi services, massage services -- they're a lot cheaper in poorer countries.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13y49v0Zp1c
"Purchasing Power Parity: When in India, Get a Haircut","The fact that services are cheaper in poorer countries is often called the Balassa-Samuelson effect, after BÃ©la Balassa and Paul Samuelson pointed out this fact and developed models to explain it at a deep level. The fact that services are cheaper in poorer countries also means that, on average, prices are lower -- the price level is lower. That means that each dollar has greater purchasing power in a poorer country. And so if we want to compare GDP, or if we want to compare living standards across countries, we've got to take into account the differences in purchasing power. And that leads us to our next video on purchasing power parity corrections.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13y49v0Zp1c

GDP & PPP,"Welcome. Today, we're going to be looking at GDP, gross domestic product, and PPP, purchasing power parity. These are very useful concepts if we want to compare  the economy of two different countries. Let's take a look. Gross domestic product,  as you probably know, is the market value of all final  goods and services produced within a country in a year.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpJbVitlInM
GDP & PPP,"I'm not going to say so much about gross domestic product, and its problems, and its measurement because you can find this material in just about any textbook. Of course, I recommend that  you choose the best textbook. Let's move on. The problem we want to solve is this: how do we compare, let's say,  2010 US GDP of 14.5 trillion dollars with the GDP of Thailand which, in Thailand, is measured as 9.5 trillion baht? Well, the obvious idea is  to use exchange rates.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpJbVitlInM
GDP & PPP,"And, indeed, if we do this, we find that 1 dollar is equal to  about 31 baht at this point of time. So, Thai GDP by this measure is  approximately 300 billion US dollars. There are two problems, however, with using exchange rates to convert GDP. The first is that exchange rates swing a lot, and this implies implausibly large  swings in the standard of living. So, it wouldn't be at all impossible, for example, for the Thai to US dollar to baht  exchange rate to swing by, you know, 30% within a couple  of months, either up or down.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpJbVitlInM
GDP & PPP,"But this just implies -- much bigger changes in the standard of living in these two countries than is really very plausible. The second problem -- is that exchange rates are  more relevant to goods that, in fact, are exchanged to tradables -- and less relevant to non-tradables  such as many services. In fact, it turns out that non-tradables tend to be cheaper in poorer countries. That's an important fact we want to say a little bit more about. Manufactured goods tend to sell for similar prices everywhere.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpJbVitlInM
GDP & PPP,"This is the law of one price for tradables. So, for example, if you want to buy an iPad, it's going to cost you about 500 dollars, whether you buy it in the United States, whether you buy it in France after you've converted the currency, whether you buy it in China, even if you buy it in Outer Mongolia, it's still going to cost you,  when all is said and done, about 500 dollars. And the reason for this is: imagine that iPads were selling for 300 dollars in Outer Mongolia. iPads are tradable, they can easily be moved around. So, if iPads were selling for  300 dollars in Outer Mongolia and 500 dollars in the United States, it would make sense to buy iPads  in Outer Mongolia for 300, ship them into the United States, sell them there for 500  until the prices equalize.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpJbVitlInM
GDP & PPP,"The same is not true for services. Services tend to be quite a bit  cheaper in poorer countries. You can get cheap haircuts, cheap cooks, and cheap house cleaners in a poorer country. This is because labor is non-tradable. Labor, at least in our world, is immobile.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpJbVitlInM
GDP & PPP,"So, for example, you can get a cheap cook in India, an expensive cook in the United States, but you don't see lots of cooks moving from India to the United States, at least not compared to the numbers of people who could move. So, the exchange rate, because of this, is more closely related to the relative price of tradable goods. Tradable goods will be exchanged through the arbitrage process I just discussed until, in fact, the exchange rate makes it such that tradable goods sell for about the same price everywhere once you've done all the currency conversions. The same is not true for labor. The same is not true for service goods, for goods, for non-tradables, for immobile goods.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpJbVitlInM
GDP & PPP,"So, as a result of this, calculations of GDP based on exchange rates -- tend to overestimate the cost of living in poorer countries -- because they take into account that tradables are about the same price but not that non-tradables are cheaper in poorer countries. This is called the BalassaâSamuelson effect and you can find more about it by listening to the video on BÃ©la Balassa. Okay. Given this, how do we compare GDP of two different countries? Well, we're going to use a method very similar to what we do to compare GDP over time in the same country.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpJbVitlInM
GDP & PPP,"So, let's remember what nominal GDP is. So, nominal GDP is just the market value of all final goods and services sold in a country within a year. So, for example, if we want to look at nominal GDP in the United States in 2005, that's 2005 prices times 2005 quantities; turns out to be equal to 12.4 trillion dollars. If we look at 1995 GDP in the United States, that's 1995 prices times 1995 quantities at 7.4 trillion dollars. The growth of nominal GDP,  then subtracting these numbers, that turns out to be equal to 67.6%.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpJbVitlInM
GDP & PPP,"We really don't think, however, that the growth and living standard has gone up by 67% between 1995 and 2005. The growth of nominal GDP over this ten-year period includes price increases as well as increases in output. So, the solution to this problem is  to calculate GDP in each year using the same set of prices. So, for example, we can calculate 2005 GDP, just as we did before, as 2005 prices times 2005 quantities. That's, again, 12.4 trillion dollars.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpJbVitlInM
GDP & PPP,"Now, however, let's calculate 1995 GDP in 2005 dollars. That is, we're going to use  2005 prices times 1995 quantities. That gets us 1995 GDP in 2005 dollars and that's 9.0 trillion dollars. So, the growth rate of real GDP -- turns out to be 37.8%. Not bad, but not the 67% that we saw earlier.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpJbVitlInM
GDP & PPP,"So, the idea here is that using the same set of prices eliminates the effect of  price changes on GDP. Let's try the same trick for comparing the economies of two different countries. So, to compare GDP over time, we create a basket of goods, which is comparable over time, and we look at how the price of  that basket changed over time. So, we can find, for example, that  a basket of goods which cost $10 in 1915; we can trace that same basket  all the way through 2005 where it cost 207 dollars. We can use that series of price changes to calculate real GDP over time.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpJbVitlInM
GDP & PPP,"Let's use the same idea for comparing GDP between countries. We need to create a basket of goods which is comparable between countries and look at the prices of  that basket in different countries. If we do this and we find, for example, that the price for the basket is Pa in country A and Pb in country B, then the purchasing power  parity ratio is Pa/Pb. That is, the number of units of country A's currency that are needed to purchase the same basket of goods and services as one unit of country B's currency will purchase in country B. Okay, that's kind of a mouthful, so let's give an example. Let's take a look at the most famous  purchasing power parity ratio or index, the Big Mac Index, which is  produced by The Economist.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpJbVitlInM
GDP & PPP,"The Big Mac is a basket of goods. It's a basket of bread, and beef,  and cheese, and onions, and also the labor required to cook these products and to deliver them. So in the United States,  this basket of goods can be bought for about  4 dollars and 45 cents. In Thailand, the exact same basket, the same Big Mac, you can buy it for 70 baht. What that suggests, for example, -- is that somebody who earns  70 baht an hour in Thailand has above the same standard of living as somebody who earns 4.45 dollars an hour in the United States.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpJbVitlInM
GDP & PPP,"Notice, however, that the actual  exchange rate is not 1 dollar to 15.74 baht, it's actually 1 to 29.6 baht. In other words, if you take that 70 baht in Thailand and you convert it into dollars, you're only going to get  2 dollars and 36 cents. This might suggest,  if you used the exchange rate to look at standard of living, this would suggest that somebody  who earns 70 baht an hour in Thailand, actually, has a standard of living equivalent only to 2.36 dollars an hour in the United States while, in fact, we know  the actual equivalent is 4.45 dollars an hour. We know that the person in Thailand can afford a Big Mac, not just half a Big Mac as the exchange rate would suggest. Well, why is this?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpJbVitlInM
GDP & PPP,"Well this is the BalassaâSamuelson effect. It's the fact that the Big Mac  contains a labor component. And labor is cheaper in Thailand -- which means that it's cheaper to live  in Thailand than you would expect from the exchange rate alone. Another way of putting that, is that people in Thailand have  a higher standard of living than you would expect given  the exchange rate alone. This is why we want to convert using purchasing power parity ratios rather than using exchange rates.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpJbVitlInM
GDP & PPP,"By the way, you can also see that -- down here, where it's actually cheaper to live, these tend to be poorer countries. Well, up here, where the exchange rate is, you could say, overvalued, where a Big Mac cost you 8 dollars  for example in Norway, these tend to be the richer countries. Again, this is very consistent with  the BalassaâSamuelson effect. So, remember, we want to convert using the purchasing power parity ratios in order to take into account that some goods, particularly non-tradable goods, are cheaper in poorer countries. And we do that by using the same  basket of goods in all countries.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpJbVitlInM
GDP & PPP,"The Big Mac index gives us the right idea, but we'd really like  a bigger basket of goods. After all, the Big Mac doesn't include everything. So, this is what the World Bank's  International Comparison program does. It creates a very large basket of goods to try and create PPP adjusted real GDP. By the way, when you do this, Thailand's  GDP based on exchange rates is 300 billion.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpJbVitlInM
GDP & PPP,"When you do it based on PPP which,  for all the reasons we've discussed, is a more accurate account of the strength of an economy or the standard of living, it's 585 billion, a larger number. Now, it's very difficult to make real  GDP comparisons over long periods of time. This is because it's difficult to find a comparable basket of  goods over periods of time. We consume a lot of goods today like iPads which simply weren't available  20 years, let alone 80 years ago. We also changed our consumption patterns over time.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpJbVitlInM
GDP & PPP,"So, we consume a lot fewer  horseshoes today than we did a hundred years ago. But if horseshoes are a little bit more expensive today, you wouldn't want to say that that means our standard  of living has gone down a lot. Goods change in quality over time as well. We have very similar problems when  we're trying to make comparisons of GDP between very different countries. Let's take a look.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpJbVitlInM
GDP & PPP,"So, how we're going to make  this international basket comparable? We have a number of problems. First, I'll call the rice problem. Well, rice seems like something  we ought to be very easily able to compare across countries. But, yet, when you look in more detail, you say: well, are you comparing long grain rice or short grain rice?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpJbVitlInM
GDP & PPP,"brown rice or white rice? Uncle Ben's or Kismet rice? So, all kinds of different types of rice, and we need to try as best as we can to make account of those differences. There's also what I call  the croissant problem. For some reason, croissants are just a lot better in Paris than they are in Washington DC.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpJbVitlInM
GDP & PPP,"You can go to a bakery right off the street in Paris and the croissant just tastes  a lot crunchier, and crisper, and yet soft inside than the one you buy in Washington DC. So, there are quality differences which we'd like to take into account, if we possibly can. But, of course, that is hard to do. Then, there's the cheese problem or the consumption weight problem. We consume a lot of cheese in the United States.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpJbVitlInM
GDP & PPP,"They don't consume very much in China. So, if cheese is more expensive in China than it is in the United States, that doesn't mean that the Chinese  have a lower standard of living because they don't want to buy the cheese anyway. So, we have to try and take it into account. This basket of the goods has to be comparable across countries. So, we don't want to use the US consumption ratios.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpJbVitlInM
GDP & PPP,"In fact, we don't want to use the Chinese consumption ratios either. We want to try and create some middle ground. Then, there's a health care problem. How do you measure the prices of goods which aren't bought and sold in markets? Health care is a big part of GDP -- and yet, for the most part, we don't have prices for a heart surgery, or for diabetic treatment, or something like this.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpJbVitlInM
GDP & PPP,"So, in these cases, we usually measure by the cost of the inputs which is not as good a solution. Then, everything that I've said so far also applies. We want to look at producer goods, you know, the welding equipment. How are you going to find comparable welding equipment? So, everything I've said  about consumption goods, creating a basket of consumption goods, we also want to include  in there, producer goods.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpJbVitlInM
GDP & PPP,"So, that just adds to our problems. The quality of data in poorer  countries also tends to be quite poor. So, this motivates other ways of trying to figure out what GDP or standard of living is like. Electricity consumption is another proxy for standard of living. And you can actually estimate this, and Henderson, Storeygard, Weil did this in a paper called ""Measuring Economic Growth  from Outer Space"" by looking at the lights at night.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpJbVitlInM
GDP & PPP,"Here's a famous picture: this is from my textbook with Tyler, showing South Korea down here. Lots of lights. Lots of action. This is at night. Lots of people going on to parties.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpJbVitlInM
GDP & PPP,"This is North Korea up here. Pretty quiet. You can therefore see,  just by looking at the lights, that North Korea is a much poorer country than South Korea. You can look at this,  not just at a point in time, but you can actually  see the lights coming on. You can actually see economic growth as it happens.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpJbVitlInM
GDP & PPP,"In China, for example, you see literally  the lights turning on at night as the country becomes richer. So, this is another way of trying to get at some of these issues. So, what's the bottom line? Well, the bottom line is,  despite some problems, PPP adjusted GDP or real GDP, it's a very useful statistic  for comparing countries. So, we can look at the total GDP of the United States, this is in 2007, was 12.9 trillion dollars.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpJbVitlInM
GDP & PPP,"The real GDP per capita was 42.8. You can compare that with China  which had a very large total GDP, 8.4 trillion, almost as large as  the United States. The GDP per capita, however,  was much much lower. India even lower yet. So, even though it's imperfect, these real PPP adjusted GDP statistics are very useful for comparing countries and for looking at how countries are growing over time.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpJbVitlInM
GDP & PPP,Thanks.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpJbVitlInM
The Solow Model 1 - Introduction,"Hi. So today we begin our first lecture  on the Solow Model. This is a workhorse model in economics, not just for understanding growth, but also in further developments  for understanding business cycles. The model was developed by Robert Solow and he won the Nobel Prize in 1987, largely for his work on this model. In this lecture, we're going to begin  with the super simple Solow Model, which is the version that Tyler and I developed in our textbook ""Modern Principles"".",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqUuxEQUt4I
The Solow Model 1 - Introduction,"So if you want to follow along,  I'd get a hold of that textbook. The Solow Model begins with  the production function, which is simply a mathematical model  describing how output is produced. So we're going to write output 'Y'  as a function of physical capital 'K', human capital, which we're  going to write as 'e times L'. You can think of that as education times the number of laborers. Ideas, which we're going to write as 'A'.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqUuxEQUt4I
The Solow Model 1 - Introduction,"Later on, we will also interpret this 'A' factor as productivity. So we're going to write output is  equal to a function of ideas, physical capital and human capital. Now to begin, we're going to assume  that 'A', 'e', and 'L' are constant. So there's no population growth, there's no idea growth, there's no education growth. This is nice because it means  that we can then write: output is simply a function of capital.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqUuxEQUt4I
The Solow Model 1 - Introduction,"Now, what kind of function is this? What kind of property do we want  this function to have? Basically, there are two. Clearly, we want more capital to produce more output, a positive function. But we want it to do so  at a diminishing rate.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqUuxEQUt4I
The Solow Model 1 - Introduction,"That is, each addition to capital should generate smaller additions to output, the more capital we have already. I'll explain that a bit more in a second. A nice simple function  which has these properties is the square root function. So we're going to write: output is  equal to the square root of capital. For example, if there are 16 units  of capital, then output is 4.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqUuxEQUt4I
The Solow Model 1 - Introduction,"Let's describe this function in more detail. Okay, so here is our production function. We have capital along the horizontal axis  and output along the vertical axis. And notice that at a capital stock of 100, you get an output of 10, the square root of that. At a capital stock of 400,  you get an output of 20.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqUuxEQUt4I
The Solow Model 1 - Introduction,"Okay, notice also that this graph  has diminishing returns. Let me show you what I mean. Let's suppose this is a farm,  a wheat farm, and let's imagine that a tractor is  100 units of capital, this is arbitrary. Your first tractor, that helps you to produce 10 units of output. Your first tractor helps you  to produce 10 units of output.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqUuxEQUt4I
The Solow Model 1 - Introduction,"The second tractor's not quite  as useful as the first tractor because you've already  got one tractor running. So the second tractor you can't run quite as often. You only get about 4 or 4.1 units  of output from your second tractor. What about the third tractor? Well, the third tractor you can only use, let's say, when the first two  tractors break down.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqUuxEQUt4I
The Solow Model 1 - Introduction,"So on average, your third tractor produces even less than your second tractor did. In fact, adding a third tractor now gets  you only about 3 or 3.1 units of output, 3.2 or something like that. Okay, so this is our production function. It has diminishing returns to capital. We've only just begun to develop the model but already there are some hints and some ideas we'll be developing  in future lectures.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqUuxEQUt4I
The Solow Model 1 - Introduction,"In particular, due to  diminishing returns to capital, countries with small capital stocks  should grow rapidly. So you take a country where  the capital stock is really low and that means that the productivity  of capital ought to be high. So even a little bit of investment ought to generate you a big increase in output,  a high growth rate. So China may be one example of this. So, in China they are almost literally, literally in fact, adopting the first tractors.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqUuxEQUt4I
The Solow Model 1 - Introduction,"Those first tractors are increasing  agricultural output tremendously, which is a high growth rate. In fact, across all kinds of  sectors of the economy, China is adding its first units of capital and that is growing the economy rapidly. What this does also suggest, however, is that China is going to slow down  as capital accumulates. Now, if it's the case that countries with small  capital stocks should grow rapidly, why don't all poor countries grow rapidly? If you look around the world,  it's just simply not the case that poor countries on average  grow faster than rich countries.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqUuxEQUt4I
The Solow Model 1 - Introduction,"In fact, the reason they're poor  is often that their growth rate is low. So why aren't all poor countries  growing rapidly? Well, what China did is  adopt more capitalist institutions. It freed up its property markets. It improved incentives, you know,  after the death of Mao, in particular.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqUuxEQUt4I
The Solow Model 1 - Introduction,"And it was only after  it improved its institutions, that it was able to take advantage of the high productivity of capital  and to grow rapidly. So, here we've got a hint  at something else we're going to be talking more about, conditional convergence. The countries can grow rapidly towards what we might call  their natural GDP per capita, what we might call the GDP per capita,  which is sort of fundamentalist, comes out of the fundamental  quality of their institutions, the fundamental savings rate, and so forth. Things we'll be talking about more later. Okay, here's another  interesting application.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqUuxEQUt4I
The Solow Model 1 - Introduction,"Bombing a country,  can increase its growth rate. Let's look at some data. So this is data from Germany,  Japan and the United States. Let's start with 1950 to 1960,  the decade after World War II. What do we see?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqUuxEQUt4I
The Solow Model 1 - Introduction,"Well, we see Germany growing  at a 6.6 percent growth rate, Japan at a 6.8 percent growth rate. Meanwhile, the United States  is only growing at 1.2 percent. What is going on? How is it that the losers of World War II  are growing more rapidly than the winner? To a lot of people  this just didn't seem right.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqUuxEQUt4I
The Solow Model 1 - Introduction,"But actually, the explanation is pretty simple. The explanation is that huge amounts of the capital stock  in Germany and Japan were destroyed. So Germany and Japan  had a low capital stock but their fundamental  convergence GDP per capita rate, the rate towards which their fundamentals  were leading them was high. So their capital stock  indeed was very productive. They were able to invest a lot  and growth rates were very high.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqUuxEQUt4I
The Solow Model 1 - Introduction,"However, as capital accumulated  their growth rates fell. So Germany fell to  1.9 percent from 1989 to 1990, Japan to 3.4 percent, and of course, in the next decade  it slowed down even more, the United States at 2.3 percent. This also suggests another idea we're going to be talking  more about in future lectures. You see if these high rates, 6.6 percent in Germany and Japan and so forth, China's 10 percent rate, if these high rates  are all about catching up, all about really high  productivity capital, where you're catching up to  your natural level of GDP per capita. You know, what is determining this rate, where you're at your sort of  natural GDP per capita rate?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqUuxEQUt4I
The Solow Model 1 - Introduction,"What is determining growth  on the cutting edge? We'll be talking more about that when  we talk about ideas in a future lecture. Okay, let's get back to  developing the model. So, we've talked about  how capital produces output. Now we want to say, well,  what do you do with that output?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqUuxEQUt4I
The Solow Model 1 - Introduction,"We're going to split it  into two basic things. You can invest the output,  or you can consume the output. So, we have a very simple  and good model here. Think about potatoes, you know you  produce potatoes, that's your output. You can invest.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqUuxEQUt4I
The Solow Model 1 - Introduction,"You can take some of those potatoes  and plant them back into the ground. That's an investment of potatoes in order to produce  more potatoes in the next period, or you can consume the potatoes. So those are the two things  we're going to let output do. We're going to assume that people  take a constant fraction of output and save and invest that constant fraction. So here is our investment curve,  the green line.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqUuxEQUt4I
The Solow Model 1 - Introduction,"Investment, in our case, is going to be  equal to 30 percent of output, so a savings rate of 30 percent. In other words, our investment curve  is equal to 0.3 times ""Y"". So we take here as our output curve  and we multiply that by 0.3. That gives us our investment curve. In other words, investment is equal to  0.3 times the square root of ""K"".",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqUuxEQUt4I
The Solow Model 1 - Introduction,"Let's take a given capital stock. So if we have a capital stock of 100, that means that output is 10,  the square root of that. And of those 10 units of output,  three units are going to be invested and seven units are going to be consumed. Pretty simple. The next thing we need  to add to our model, the next fact we need  to take into account, is that capital depreciates.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqUuxEQUt4I
The Solow Model 1 - Introduction,"So those tractors begin to rust,  they begin to fall apart. Think about a car. You bring home a new car. It runs perfectly but after a while  it needs more maintenance. it needs more oil checks.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqUuxEQUt4I
The Solow Model 1 - Introduction,The brakes start to fail. Things start to fail. You have to invest money just to keep the car running  the way it was when you bought it as new. Factories begin to depreciate. There is wear and tear on the factories.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqUuxEQUt4I
The Solow Model 1 - Introduction,"Water systems, sewer systems  begin to corrode. They begin to fall apart over time. And you need to invest just to keep you  at the same place that you were before. So this is depreciation, this is  capital depreciation, wear and tear. Here's how we add  depreciation to our model.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqUuxEQUt4I
The Solow Model 1 - Introduction,"Depreciation, we're going to write as just a constant fraction of the capital stock. So we'll write that every  100 units of capital you have, two units depreciate every period, so a depreciation rate of 2%. This means that  every 100 units of capital, you have two of them  wear out every period. Now, what's going to turn out  to be very important, is the relationship between  the investment function, in green, and the depreciation function  here in siena. In fact, we want to focus in on this  because this is the whole model.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqUuxEQUt4I
The Solow Model 1 - Introduction,"A lot of the model  will be driven by this. Let's focus in on this area. We're going to blow up these two curves so we can see what's going on  a little bit more clearly. Okay, here's our investment curve  and our depreciation curve, exactly as we had before. I've just blown them up  so they're easier to see.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqUuxEQUt4I
The Solow Model 1 - Introduction,"Now, here is the key to the model. When investment is bigger  than depreciation and when you are investing more capital  than is depreciating every period, then your capital stock must be growing. Similarly, when depreciation  is bigger than investment, when more capital is depreciating  every period than you are investing, then your capital stock  is getting smaller. So the capital stock is growing  anywhere in this green area over here, anywhere in this green area. The capital stock is getting smaller  anywhere in this red area.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqUuxEQUt4I
The Solow Model 1 - Introduction,"So the capital stock is shrinking. If capital stock is growing over here  and shrinking over here then the one place where  the capital stock is constant is where the investment  is equal to depreciation. This point is the steady state,  where investment is equal to depreciation. The capital stock is holding constant. It's neither growing nor shrinking.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqUuxEQUt4I
The Solow Model 1 - Introduction,"The capital stock is constant  when you are investing, every period, just enough to replace  the capital which has depreciated. That's the steady state, when you are investing just enough to replace the capital which has depreciated. Okay, now we've brought  the output curve back in, so we can see the whole model in one diagram. Let's remember that the steady state is  when investment is equal to depreciation. That turns out to be a capital stock, where the capital stock is 225,  right here.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqUuxEQUt4I
The Solow Model 1 - Introduction,"The investment equal to  the depreciation is 4.5. That's given right here. Then the output,  the steady-state output, is equal to 15. That is when the capital stock is 225. The square root of that is 15.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqUuxEQUt4I
The Solow Model 1 - Introduction,"We can think about this,  by the way, as GDP per capita. So, the Solow Model is  telling us a couple of things. First of all, it's a model of  GDP per capita. It tells us, we haven't  gone into this in great detail, but you can see it will have something  to do with the savings rate. The savings rate is going to be higher.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqUuxEQUt4I
The Solow Model 1 - Introduction,"You can see this curve  is going to shift up. We're going to get  a bigger steady-state output. We'll talk more about that  in a future lecture. You can also see that this tells us  something about the growth rate, that you're going to grow when you're  below your steady-state capital stock. Finally, it tells us that  that growth is going to taper off, that growth is going to slow down.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqUuxEQUt4I
The Solow Model 1 - Introduction,"You're eventually going to come to a point where the investment is  equal to the depreciation. That is, your capital stock is going to grow so large, such that at some point all of your investment is is going to be taken up  just maintaining the capital stock. So, you're going to build  so many aqueducts, think of Rome, so many sewers, so many  water supplies, so many factories that every period the depreciation on those bits of capital is going to be so large that it's going to take up  all of your investment. And that's when growth stops. So this model is telling us something,  which at first is a little bit surprising.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqUuxEQUt4I
The Solow Model 1 - Introduction,"It's telling us that capital growth alone, capital deepening, cannot be responsible for long-run growth. At some point your capital stock will be  so large that it's all going to be, all of your investment is going to be  consumed by making up for depreciation. So this model is telling us we're going  to have to look somewhere else to understand long-run growth. And of course, when we get there,  we're going to be talking about ideas. We're going to put the model through its paces in the next few lectures.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqUuxEQUt4I
The Solow Model 1 - Introduction,Thanks.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqUuxEQUt4I
The Solow Model 2: Comparative Statics,"Hi. So in our second lecture on the Solow Model, we're going to do some comparative statics. We're going to see what happens when you change the saving rate, for example. We're also going to add in  ideas and population growth, and see what happens when you change those factors as well. Let's get going.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmsSIoGtyh4
The Solow Model 2: Comparative Statics,"Let's briefly review the Solow Model. So, remember that the key  to the model is the steady-state, is when investment  is equal to depreciation. When investment is equal to depreciation, the economy is neither growing nor shrinking, and we can read off this graph  what the GDP per capita is. Okay. What happens now if our savings rate, which is, let's say, 30%, what happens if the savings rate were to go let's say 40%?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmsSIoGtyh4
The Solow Model 2: Comparative Statics,"So with an increase  in the savings rate, what happens is the entire investment curve shifts up. In particular, beginning at  the old steady-state rate, what happens immediately  is that you get investment which is now  greater than depreciation. And because investment is greater than depreciation, you get capital accumulation. That capital stock will continue to grow, will get larger and larger until we reach the point where  investment is equal to depreciation, until we reach the point  where the capital stock is so large that it depreciates enough each period that you need all of your investment simply to maintain the capital stock  at its new higher level. Notice that at the new  higher level of capital stock, we have a higher GDP per capita.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmsSIoGtyh4
The Solow Model 2: Comparative Statics,"Let's now add ideas to the model. Remember we began with  a very general production function in which output was created by ideas,  physical capital and human capital, and we simplified it to output  as a square root of the capital stock. Let's now do something again very simple, let's make output as equal to A  times the square root of capital. Notice here that an increase in A means that you get more increase  for the same amount of capital stock. So that's the sense in which  A represents ideas or productivity; more output from the same capital stock.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmsSIoGtyh4
The Solow Model 2: Comparative Statics,"This graph looks initially  a little bit complicated, but it's really not, we're going to take it in steps. What this graph shows us is what happens  when you increase productivity, what happens when you increase ideas. So our previous model, we can think of as A as being equal to 1. Now let's suppose that A goes up to 1.5. This means because you've got better productivity, for every unit of capital, you now are getting 50% more output -- from that unit of capital.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmsSIoGtyh4
The Solow Model 2: Comparative Statics,"So, a couple of things happen. Let's begin at our old steady-state,  225 units of capital. The old curves are shown  by the dashed line. Here's our old steady-state. Suppose that at this point, -- that we have an increase in productivity which increases A to 1.5.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmsSIoGtyh4
The Solow Model 2: Comparative Statics,"Well, the first thing that happens  is that better ideas, means you get more output from  the same amount of capital we had before, more output from the same capital stock. But because we have more output, we also have more investment. Okay, more output means more investment. And now investment is going to be greater than depreciation. Because investment is greater than depreciation, we get capital accumulation.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmsSIoGtyh4
The Solow Model 2: Comparative Statics,"Capital accumulation increases GDP, -- increases GDP per person, GDP per capita. So we get two things going on. We get the initial effect of  better ideas increases output, that secondary effect then with higher  levels of output for a given capital stock that encourages more capital accumulation. We're going to continue  accumulating capital until we reach the point where  investment is equal to depreciation, until our capital stock is so large  that we're using -- all of our investment  just to maintain the capital stock. Notice, however, that with better ideas, our capital stock increases, as does the amount of GDP per capita.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmsSIoGtyh4
The Solow Model 2: Comparative Statics,"We're not going to say a lot in this course about the development of ideas, about cutting edge growth, about why the United States grows at,  you know, 2.5% instead of 7%, you know, what determines improvements in technology over time. Do however take a look  at some of the work of Paul Romer, or you could take a look at  my own TED talk, or my book, ""Launching the Innovation Renaissance"". We will come back later to talk about a somewhat different  interpretation of the A term in our production function,  as a productivity term. We will be asking why is it that some countries don't seem able to take advantage of all the ideas on the technological frontier, or why some countries are less able  to combine capital and labor in the most efficient ways, to get the most output out of  their capital and labor as is possible. So we'll come back and talk about that second interpretation a little bit later.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmsSIoGtyh4
The Solow Model 2: Comparative Statics,"Let's add population growth to the model. This is going to take a little bit of mathematics, not much, but bear with me. So we wrote our production function  in very general terms, and then we simplified it to output is equal to A  times the square root of K. We can also write this as A times K to . 5 or to the one half. This is exactly the same thing,  just a slightly different notation style, it means exactly the same thing.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmsSIoGtyh4
The Solow Model 2: Comparative Statics,"When we do that, a natural way to generalize this might be to add in labor,  with the same format, and as long as we're generalizing,  let's do that this way. At . 5, there's nothing special about . 5, it's just an easy square root  which is just easy to work with, let's generalize this to  output is equal to A times K to the alpha times L to the 1 minus alpha. A good reason for writing  the production function in this way, which is what is called the Cobb-Douglas production function, -- is that when you double capital and labor, you double output.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmsSIoGtyh4
The Solow Model 2: Comparative Statics,"So if we're thinking about capital and labor as the only factors of production, it makes sense that if you double  the only things you need to produce, you have to double output as well, and this production function has that property. Okay. It's going to be a little bit easier if we write this in terms of GDP per capita or output per person. Let's assume that every person is a worker. So we're going to divide both sides by L, and then we're going to simplify  this term and rewrite a few things.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmsSIoGtyh4
The Solow Model 2: Comparative Statics,"Let's do that. Here's our production function carried over from the last slide. We want to simplify this, so we just use our rules for exponents to divide through with the L, that gets us L to the negative alpha. Notice that L to the negative alpha is the same as 1 over L to the alpha. So we can rewrite this portion as -- output per worker is equal to A times the capital per worker  to the power of alpha.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmsSIoGtyh4
The Solow Model 2: Comparative Statics,"Now, let's just define -- output per worker as little y and define capital per worker as little k, and then we get this new production function: little y is equal to A k to the alpha. Now notice that, even though  the interpretation is different, the form of this equation is exactly our super-simple Solow form. It's exactly, with the difference being we've got  an alpha instead of a square root, we've generalized it slightly, but it's exactly the same form as we had before. So in fact, the Solow Model goes through, exactly as we had before, except now we're just going to  interpret it in terms of output per worker and capital per worker. Let's take a look at that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmsSIoGtyh4
The Solow Model 2: Comparative Statics,"So here we have the Solow Model again, except now we're writing it in per worker terms, so this is output,  now explicitly per worker, this is capital per worker. Here's our production function,  again, in terms of output per worker and capital per worker. Our investment function looks the same except, again, it's in per worker terms, it's now investment per worker, and I've generalized a little bit, giving this a gamma -- to denote our savings rate. The major difference, and it's really not even a major difference, is our depreciation function. It's written again  in terms of capital per worker, and then we have this extra term here.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmsSIoGtyh4
The Solow Model 2: Comparative Statics,"Now, think about capital per worker. How could you depreciate  the amount of capital per worker? Well, there's really two ways of doing it. One is, you could depreciate capital in the sense that we've been  talking about before, wear and tear; capital just wears out. Okay?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmsSIoGtyh4
The Solow Model 2: Comparative Statics,"So you lose capital, that means capital per worker depreciates or goes down. The other way you can depreciate  capital per worker, however, is with more workers. And we're going to introduce  the population growth rate, or the worker growth rate as N. So there's two ways of depreciating capital per worker: you can have less capital with  straight depreciation or more workers. So, even though the terms  are a little bit different, the interpretation's a little bit different, the flavor of the model's exactly  as we have before, and we can now see, for example, that if you were to increase  the depreciation rate, -- either because  capital depreciation goes up; maybe we're dealing with computers now which depreciate faster than buildings; or, because population growth rate goes up then this curve is going to shift,  you know, like this, and you're going to get an equilibrium, a lower amount of output per worker and capital per worker. Let's take a look at that  using a Mathematica example.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmsSIoGtyh4
The Solow Model 2: Comparative Statics,"Okay, here's a nice  little demonstration project using Mathematica. You can find this demonstration at this address up here. If you get Wolfram's CDF player,  sort of like a PDF, you can actually easily embed this demonstration project on any web page. So here we begin,  here's our steady state, as usual down with a capital stock of 225 and investment equals to depreciation. You can adjust this,  so let's have the savings rate.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmsSIoGtyh4
The Solow Model 2: Comparative Statics,"You increase the savings rate, and, as we know, the curve, the savings curve, shifts up, okay? You get a higher capital stock, you get greater GDP per capita; you can move the savings rate like this. Here's what happens with better ideas, better technology, that shifts the curve upwards. Let's reduce our savings rate down here, shift the technology curve upwards, the better idea curve, and we get -- greater GDP per capita  for this same capital stock, and because higher GDP per capita  increases the incentive to invest, we get a larger capital stock as well. Let's move the savings rate back here, -- move this down here.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmsSIoGtyh4
The Solow Model 2: Comparative Statics,"Here's the depreciation rate. And you can see with a higher -- depreciation rate,  you get lower GDP per capita, lower capital. Remember that we can also now interpret the depreciation rate as capital depreciation  plus population growth. So this tells us that  if we're thinking about GDP per worker and capital per worker, that greater population growth reduces GDP per capita. Smaller population growth increases  GDP per capita and the capital stock.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmsSIoGtyh4
The Solow Model 2: Comparative Statics,"Okay. Again, you can easily embed this onto your web page if you want to. Last thing we want to talk about is -- let's take this model to data. How much of the data  can the Solow Model explain? That's what we're going to take up in our next lecture.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmsSIoGtyh4
The Solow Model 2: Comparative Statics,Thanks.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmsSIoGtyh4
The Solow Model 3 -- Taking the Model to Data,"In our third lecture on the Solow Model,  we're going to take the model to data and see whether the model is consistent with the basic facts of economic growth, Let's take a look. So from our previous lectures, we know that in the Solow Model GDP per capita is a positive function  of savings or investment, a positive function of human capital, and a negative function  of population growth. So from this point of view,  the secret to development is quite simple, it's to follow what Bill Easterly  has called the Victorian values: work hard and save, study hard, and don't have too much sex, that is, limit childbearing. So let's see from some data,  whether these predictions hold up. What we're showing here is the relationship between  real GDP per capita in 2005, where we're thinking about this as sort of the steady-state level of GDP per capita, and the mean or average investment rate  over the previous 35 years.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG4m_4uhZIA
The Solow Model 3 -- Taking the Model to Data,"And what we're showing is that countries  which invested more over those 35 years ended up with  a higher level of GDP per capita, so quite consistent with the Solow Model. By the way, I've taken the data here from  David Weil's book Economic Growth. This is a textbook. It's very good,  you may want to take a look at it. Our second bit of data  looks at real GDP per capita against the average years of schooling.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG4m_4uhZIA
The Solow Model 3 -- Taking the Model to Data,"And again we see  a pretty nice close, tight relationship, more years of schooling, more  human capital, greater GDP per capita. Now of course the causality here  could be going the other way. Perhaps it's just in rich countries  that people have a lot of schooling because schooling can be fun,  at least for some of us, not for all of us. So that's possible too. But nevertheless, the basic facts  are consistent with the Solow Model.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG4m_4uhZIA
The Solow Model 3 -- Taking the Model to Data,"So here we're showing the average  or mean population growth rate over the previous 35 years. Again, real GDP per capita  on the vertical axis. And we see, as the Solow Model predicts, a negative relationship between the population growth rate  and real GDP per capita. Now again, here the causality  is not necessarily all running from the population growth rate  to real GDP per capita. Perhaps in poor countries,  they have more children.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG4m_4uhZIA
The Solow Model 3 -- Taking the Model to Data,"Perhaps they have more children  because that's one of the only ways in which they can save for retirement. That is, have somebody there,  have a child there to take care of them. So there are different interpretations. Nevertheless, the prediction is  consistent with the Solow Model. Looking pretty good for the Solow Model.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG4m_4uhZIA
The Solow Model 3 -- Taking the Model to Data,"The Solow Model, however, offers  more than just qualitative predictions. By putting a little bit more  structure on the model we can actually get  some quantitative predictions. That's really what we want to do. So let's take a closer look. Let's remember that the key  to the Solow Model is that you reach the steady state when investment is equal to depreciation.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG4m_4uhZIA
The Solow Model 3 -- Taking the Model to Data,"Let's take the equations for investment and depreciation and set that up. So that means that taking  the investment here, and depreciation here the steady state is found  when this equation is true. Now let's remember that the ""y"" here is output per person, OK? That is equal to ""A"" times the  capital-labor ratio to the power of alpha. So let's just substitute that in right there.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG4m_4uhZIA
The Solow Model 3 -- Taking the Model to Data,"Substitute for ""y"" and we get this. So here's our equation  for the steady state. So let's work a little bit  with our equation and see whether we can get some more  quantitative predictions out of that. OK, here's the same equation we had on  the previous page, just to remind us. Now let's work  with this equation a little bit, Let's divide both sides by  ""k"" to the power of alpha.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG4m_4uhZIA
The Solow Model 3 -- Taking the Model to Data,"So if we do that, we get this alright? Now what we want to do is isolate ""k"". So let's take both sides of this equation and take them to the power  of 1 over 1 minus alpha. OK, that's going to get rid  of this term here. So if we do that and then we move ""k"" over here, we rearrange and put this stuff over here, what we get is this equation.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG4m_4uhZIA
The Solow Model 3 -- Taking the Model to Data,"And lo and behold,  this is the steady state level of ""k"", the steady state level of capital, the capitals, excuse me, the steady state capital-labor ratio. I've marked it with a star,  indicating this is the steady state level. And what we've done here is we've expressed the  steady state level of capital in terms of these exogenous factors, in terms of the savings rate, depreciation rate,  the population growth rate, the technology term, ""A"", and this term alpha, which is a term  on the production function. It's going to turn out to be important and we're going to be talking about alpha a little bit more. So for now, however, we have isolated the steady state level of capital.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG4m_4uhZIA
The Solow Model 3 -- Taking the Model to Data,"So from our previous slide we know that the steady state level of capital is given by this expression. We also remember that output per worker is equal to ""A"" times  the capital-labor ratio to the power of this alpha term. And so substituting, if we substitute this in for here, the capital-labor ratio here, then we'll get the steady state level of output per worker. Pretty straightforward, the only possible  complication is there's an ""A"" out here. There's also an ""A"" within the parentheses here and when you combine them  and bring them outside the parentheses this is what you get.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG4m_4uhZIA
The Solow Model 3 -- Taking the Model to Data,"So, this is the level of steady state  per worker given by the Solow Model. It depends upon, in particular,  these fundamental factors here. So the next thing  we're going to want to ask is suppose we want to compare two different countries. The Solow Model says any differences in output per worker must be due to the differences in these fundamental factors. So let's ask.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG4m_4uhZIA
The Solow Model 3 -- Taking the Model to Data,"Suppose that the savings rate were different in two different countries, how much of the differences in output  per worker which we observe in the world can be explained by reasonably sized  differences in these fundamental factors? And we're going to focus on the savings rate but we can do similar exercises for the other ones as well. So that's the question we're going to ask next. This looks slightly imposing, but it's really not. We were going to compare two different countries by looking at the ratio  of their GDPs per capita.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG4m_4uhZIA
The Solow Model 3 -- Taking the Model to Data,"So from the previous line we know that the steady state GDP per capita for the United States is given by this expression here,  according to the Solow Model. And the steady state ratio of GDP per  capita for, let's say, Zambia or Zimbabwe is given by, again according to the Solow Model, by this expression here. Now let's suppose that everything  in these two countries was the same except for the savings rate. If that's the case, then a bunch of  these terms are going to drop out and you'll see that the difference in  GDP per capita is explained by the differences in the savings rate. So in particular, let's suppose that this ratio of savings rate, suppose the ratio was 4, that is, suppose that the United States saved four times as much as Zambia.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG4m_4uhZIA
The Solow Model 3 -- Taking the Model to Data,"In particular, let's imagine,  this is not the case, but let's imagine that the United States saved 20% of its output and Zambia saved 5% of its output. So the savings rates  differed by a factor of 4. If that was the case, how large a difference in  GDP per capita could we explain based upon a difference in savings rates, difference in the ratio of four? Well that, it turns out, is going to depend upon this alpha over 1 minus alpha term. And that's what we're  going to be looking at next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG4m_4uhZIA
The Solow Model 3 -- Taking the Model to Data,"So the question once again is suppose that savings rates  differed by a ratio of 4, how much could that ratio of 4 explain in terms of ratios of GDP per capita? What this graph tells us is that if alpha is small, then a difference in savings rates of 4,  a ratio of 4, is only going to be able to explain a fairly small difference in the income ratios across countries. On the other hand, if alpha is large,  if alpha is over here, then we're going to be able to explain a large difference in the income ratios by a fairly modest difference, a reasonable difference, in the savings rate. So if alpha is big and the savings rate  differs by a factor of 4, then we're going to be able to explain differences in GDP per capita  across countries of 30, a 30-time difference. A four-time savings rate difference is going to translate into  a 30-time difference in GDP per capita if alpha is big.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG4m_4uhZIA
The Solow Model 3 -- Taking the Model to Data,"But if alpha is small a 4-time difference of savings rates is only going to be able to explain  a small fraction of the difference in GDP per capita across countries. So what is alpha and how big is it? So how big is alpha? Well, in order to get a grip on this equation, we need some way of connecting alpha with something which we can measure in the real world. And to do that we need to  make some assumptions.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG4m_4uhZIA
The Solow Model 3 -- Taking the Model to Data,"We're going to assume  reasonably competitive markets and we're going to assume that the bulk  of ideas, we don't have to pay for. So you know pasteurization, Newton's laws, these are all available to us sort of free of charge as it were. Of course, you still  have to pay for capital and you still have to pay for labor, educated labor,  which understands these issues but you don't have to pay for the ideas themselves. ""A"" in other words is a public good. OK, both of these assumptions are not bad, not perfectly true of course, but  they're going to get us quite a way so they're worth making  even if they're not perfectly true.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG4m_4uhZIA
The Solow Model 3 -- Taking the Model to Data,"If we do this,  if we make these assumptions, then in particular the wage will be equal to the marginal product of labor. With competitive markets, the wage is going to be equal to  the marginal product of labor. And the marginal product of labor is the derivative of output with respect to L, which is this expression right here. Now let's take the wage  and multiply it by L. That gives us the total payments to labor. If we if we then divide by Y this gives us the fraction of  output which goes to labor, or labor share in national income.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG4m_4uhZIA
The Solow Model 3 -- Taking the Model to Data,"So this is labor share in national income. Now in terms of our expression,  it's just this and you can see there are a bunch of  things we can divide and cancel out. And what we have is this. Nice expression, whoa! It turns out that labor's share of  national income is equal to 1 minus alpha, or in other words, we can find this number in the national accounts.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG4m_4uhZIA
The Solow Model 3 -- Taking the Model to Data,"So if you go to the national accounts, what you can find is that the labor's  share of income is about 2/3. You know, wages and labor compensation that covers the bulk of GDP,  that covers the bulk of national income. OK, closely related, well after you take  into account depreciation and so forth. So in other words, if 1 minus alpha is equal to 2/3, alpha is equal to 1/3. OK, let's go back and look at our diagram.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG4m_4uhZIA
The Solow Model 3 -- Taking the Model to Data,"OK, here's our diagram again and oh, oh, if alpha is equal to 1/3, then we're only going to be able to  explain an income ratio of 2 with the savings ratio of 4. In other words, if alpha is equal to 1/3, the Solow Model is going to have real difficulty explaining large income ratios, even with pretty large-sized savings ratios. You know any reasonably sized savings  ratio is not going to be able to explain the income ratios we observe in the real  world when alpha is equal to 1/3. All right, well Mankiw, Romer and Weil, in a famous paper they said, well they made two points. They said first, if alpha is equal to 0.6, then the Solow Model  actually does pretty well at explaining any differences  in income across countries.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG4m_4uhZIA
The Solow Model 3 -- Taking the Model to Data,"Moreover, they said an alpha equal to 0.6 that's actually not too bad because labor's share isn't really about  payments to pure labor. The payment to labor's share also  represents a payment to human capital and human capital, education,  takes time to produce. So human capital really  ought to be considered a type of capital, hence the name. And if you think about human capital as capital, then capital's share, which is alpha, it's not at all unreasonable then to think that alpha is equal to 0.6. However, this is not the end of the story for a couple of reasons.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG4m_4uhZIA
The Solow Model 3 -- Taking the Model to Data,"One objection I have is that if it were really the case that the differences in income ratios was explained by savings ratios  and also by human capital, you know, why  isn't everyone rich then? You know, could it really be the case that what is holding back poor countries is a failure to save? That seems really hard to believe. Like if you went to a poor country and you said ""If only you saved, you know,  a little bit more than you're saving now, not that much more,  but if only you saved more, then within a generation, you would be  much, much richer than you are now,"" I think they would do it. Or to put it differently, a foreign aid would work much better  than it actually does if all it took to generate growth  was a difference in savings rate.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG4m_4uhZIA
The Solow Model 3 -- Taking the Model to Data,"Then we could push their savings  even temporarily higher. That would increase their income and then it could very well snowball,  it could very well keep going. So I don't think the difference is really the savings rate. There are also a couple  of other objections, even when alpha is equal to 0.6, and we'll deal with those next. The Solow Model also has implications for interest rates and skilled wages and thus for capital and labor flows.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG4m_4uhZIA
The Solow Model 3 -- Taking the Model to Data,"And here again we're going to see that the Solow Model is really not capable of explaining some of the basic facts. In particular, if poor countries are poor because  they lack capital and skilled labor, then the return on  capital and skilled labor should be much higher in poor countries. But is this true? No, it's not true. So if anything, what we observe is that  capital and skilled labor flow from poor to rich countries.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG4m_4uhZIA
The Solow Model 3 -- Taking the Model to Data,"So think about a doctor, a physician. Physicians in Africa would like to come  practice in the United States where their income would be much higher. We don't see a lot of physicians  in the United States moving to Africa in order to make a higher income. The same thing is true with capital. We don't see massively high  interest rates in poor countries and we don't see capital flowing  from rich countries to poor countries.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG4m_4uhZIA
The Solow Model 3 -- Taking the Model to Data,"Unfortunately, or in fact,  what we see quite often is that rich people in poor countries  want to take their capital abroad, want to invest in richer countries. So all of these things suggest that a higher alpha is not going  to solve all the problems, and it suggests that the Solow Model,  taken as a model of capital investment, and capital investment  as a source of growth, is not going to be able to explain all of the big differences in income ratios which we observe  in the real world. To get us really there, we're going to have to add some things to the model, we're going to have to take into account the possibility of differences in productivity across nations and that's something we'll look at in the next video. Thanks.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG4m_4uhZIA
The Solow Model 4 - Productivity,"So in our last lecture on the Solow Model we will be going beyond the model to talk about productivity. This lecture will also have  useful material even if you haven't watched  or followed completely the first three lectures  on the Solow Model. You'll have to bear with me as  I go through a little bit of math, but if you do that there will still be  plenty of material on productivity in this video to be of interest. Let's get going. To review briefly,  what was shown is that the Solow Model is consistent with the stylized  facts of economic growth.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1xRi5JPDaM
The Solow Model 4 - Productivity,"Countries which have invested more,  for example, tend to have higher levels  of GDP per capita. We've also shown, however,  that the Solow Model is inconsistent with the quantitative facts. In particular, it's hard to explain  large differences in GDP per capita based only on investment, depreciation  and population growth rates. To be more specific, it's hard to explain  the differences which exist. You can explain  fairly substantial differences but not as large as the differences  which actually exist.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1xRi5JPDaM
The Solow Model 4 - Productivity,"It's also hard to resolve the Solow Model with data on interest rates,  wages, and capital and labor flows. So to go beyond the strict Solow Model we're going to want to start  talking about productivity. A little bit of intellectual history  is in order here. When Solow wrote down his model,  he was thinking about A as being ideas  exogenous to the model, which were available  to anyone in the world. So he was thinking about A as representing Newton's laws of pasteurization, Maxwell's equation,  the Pythagorean Theorem and so forth.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1xRi5JPDaM
The Solow Model 4 - Productivity,"Ideas available to anyone. Because these ideas  were available to anyone, you couldn't use A to explain differences  in GDP per capita across countries. So to explain GDP per capita  across countries, you have to look at capital, human  capital, education, labor, and so forth. But what we've seen, however, is that these factors are not enough to explain all of the differences  in GDP per capita. So that's going to push us back to thinking about how A  may differ across countries.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1xRi5JPDaM
The Solow Model 4 - Productivity,"We're not going to be thinking about A  here so much as public goods as productivity. So what we want to do is just change  our interpretation of A a little bit to think about how well,  given the ideas that you have, how well you combine your capital  and labor to produce output. So capital and labor can be combined in less efficient and more efficient ways. And a lower A now means  a lower productivity, a less efficient combination  of capital and labor. So let's take a look at a little bit of the math.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1xRi5JPDaM
The Solow Model 4 - Productivity,"So we can divide L on both sides to get this in terms of output per worker, and we can now think about this as output per worker  is explained by two factors, by productivity and  the factors of production, which are simply the capital-labor ratio  and human capital. So were going to think about this as  output per worker is explained by productivity times factors of production. Let's take a look. Okay, now let's compare the productivity level in two different countries. We begin with our equation, which we  just had on the last page, Now let's just put two countries  one on top of each other.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1xRi5JPDaM
The Solow Model 4 - Productivity,"We'll put Zambia or Zimbabwe on the top, the US on the bottom. Here are our equations  for the two countries. Now, what we want to do is divide both  sides of the equation by this material in order to isolate  the productivity differences. We do that, we get this equation down here. Now, how do we interpret this?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1xRi5JPDaM
The Solow Model 4 - Productivity,"Well, let's suppose that  the output per worker in Zambia were half that in the United States. If the ratio of the factors of production  were also half, so the top figure here if this were a 1/2, if the ratio of the factors of production were also a 1/2, then this would be 1. This would say that  the productivity levels in the United States and Zambia were the same. So in other words, if output per worker was a 1/2,  but you had half the human capital and you had half the physical capital, then you can explain  all of that difference without resorting to  differences in productivity. On the other hand, suppose that Zambia had the same levels of human and physical capital  as the United States, so that this number was 1.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1xRi5JPDaM
The Solow Model 4 - Productivity,"They still had, however,  half the output per worker. That means that the  productivity level in Zambia must be half that of the United States. So this is just a simple way of dividing differences in output per worker in terms of those differences which can be explained by differences in the factors of production and any remaining difference, which must be due to differences in productivity. Now, let's look at what happens when  you apply this exercise empirically to data from the world. So in this table, we do  some productivity accounting.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1xRi5JPDaM
The Solow Model 4 - Productivity,"And this table, by the way, is from  David Weil's book Economic Growth, which I have already mentioned  as being a very good book. Okay, here's how you read the table. What this table tells us is that in Mexico output per worker is 0.29  the level in the United States. So the United States is defined here  arbitrarily as being equal to 1 and the level in Mexico  then is equal to 0.29, about 30% of the level  in the United States. Now, why?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1xRi5JPDaM
The Solow Model 4 - Productivity,"Why is output per worker in Mexico so low? Well, in part, it's because Mexico has  lower physical capital per worker. They also have lower  human capital per worker. Together, the factors of production  explain about half of Mexico's level of GDP per capita. In other words,  what this tells us is that if Mexico had the same physical capital  per worker as the United States, the same human capital per worker as the United States, its output per worker would still be  about half the level in the US.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1xRi5JPDaM
The Solow Model 4 - Productivity,"So what explains accounts  for the remaining half? Well, the remaining half is accounted for by productivity. Together, it's productivity  and the factors of production which explain why GDP per capita  is 0.29 that of the United States. So not only does Mexico have less  physical capital per worker and less human capital per worker, it combines its capital  in less efficient ways. It uses its capital less productively.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1xRi5JPDaM
The Solow Model 4 - Productivity,"It would lower productivity. And it's both of these factors that account for the differences in GDP per capita. And what you see over here is that differences in productivity  across countries measured in this way are surprisingly large. So even Canada, which is relatively similar to the United States, has a productivity level 20% below  that in the United States. Zambia has a productivity level which is only 15% that of the productivity level  in the United States.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1xRi5JPDaM
The Solow Model 4 - Productivity,"So that means that Zambia is labeling  under two really big problems. It's got less physical  capital, less human capital and it combines the capital that it  does have in a very inefficient way. Now there's lots that  could be said about this table. You know, how well are we actually measuring human capital per worker? How well are we measuring  physical capital per worker?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1xRi5JPDaM
The Solow Model 4 - Productivity,"Remember, productivity here is what we can't explain. So productivity is what's left over. Maybe if we have mismeasurement, the productivity level will be lower. Nevertheless, I think  it's quite accurate to say that productivity levels differ tremendously across countries. And the reason I think this is true, is that we have not simply  macroeconomic evidence for this, but it's consistent with the microeconomic evidence that we have as well.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1xRi5JPDaM
The Solow Model 4 - Productivity,"Let's take a look. So here we're showing some data from William Lewis's book, The Power of Productivity, on productivity levels in Japan  compared to the United States. Lewis, by the way, was the head  of a very large consulting group at McKinsey and Co., which did this study over many countries, many industries around the world. Now compared to the  US productivity level of 100, what we see is that  Japan did extremely well in steel, automotive parts, metal working,  cars, and consumer electronics. This makes sense.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1xRi5JPDaM
The Solow Model 4 - Productivity,"After all, we know that Japan  exports a lot of these goods, which suggests that they're able  to produce more at a lower cost. And that's exactly what  the productivity differences show, that Japan is able to produce more valuable output using less valuable inputs  than in the United States. But what about the rest of Japan? What we also see in this graph is that these industries accounted for just a little bit over 10%  of the employment in Japan. So these industries, although we think  of them as representing Japan Inc., these industries are actually pretty small relative to the whole Japanese economy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1xRi5JPDaM
The Solow Model 4 - Productivity,"So what does the rest  of the Japanese economy look like? Well, astoundingly, it looks like this. Take the retail sector. The retail sector is huge, about 50% of the entire Japanese economy, and its productivity level  is half that of the United States. Housing and construction,  another huge industry.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1xRi5JPDaM
The Solow Model 4 - Productivity,"Productivity levels are much lower than in the US. Food processing, about 30% productivity  level compared to the United States. I noticed that food processing has about  as large an employment effect as steel, automotive parts, metal working, and cars, and consumer electronics all combined, about the same size. So what accounts for these  big differences in productivity? Well, looking at the retail sector, a short way of putting it is Japan doesn't have Walmart.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1xRi5JPDaM
The Solow Model 4 - Productivity,"Japan has millions of mom-and-pop shops. And the problem is that these  mom-and-pop shops are really inefficient. They use a lot of labor and  relatively speaking, a lot of capital to not sell very much. As a result productivity is really low. Now, why is this?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1xRi5JPDaM
The Solow Model 4 - Productivity,"Well, one reason is that  for many, many years it was illegal to have a retail store in Japan  which was larger than 1,000 square meters. This was finally gotten rid of  in 2000 under US pressure, but through a combination of  land-use regulations, of subsidies, and of licenses and regulations  at the local level the retail sector has remained moribund. The retail sector has remained  full of mom-and-pop shops. Now, mom-and-pop shops may sound nice, but if you don't have Walmart, then you  also don't have Walmart putting pressure on all of its consumer manufacturers to increase productivity, to reduce costs and reduce prices. So the retail sector has knock-on effects.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1xRi5JPDaM
The Solow Model 4 - Productivity,"When you have a poor retail sector, when you have  an inefficient retail sector, you get an inefficient sector  manufacturing consumer goods. So this helps to explain why  Japan has a lower GDP level per capita than in the United States. They've got the human capital,  they've got the physical capital, but through a whole bunch of  licenses and laws, and regulations and restrictions, they're not using their physical and  human capital to its greatest potential. And if you think this is bad in Japan,  which is a developed country, it gets a hundred times worse  in a less developed country. India, for example, has all of the similar restrictions to Japan on the retail sector.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1xRi5JPDaM
The Solow Model 4 - Productivity,"India for many years also restricted the size of manufacturing firms. It said you cannot grow. It made it illegal to have a large firm. Even to do simple things often requires many licenses and many import fees and corruption  to get anything done in India. So Nandan Nilekani, for example,  is one of the founders of Infosys, one of India's successful firms.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1xRi5JPDaM
The Solow Model 4 - Productivity,"He pointed out that in 1982,  Infosys applied for permission to import a 150-megabyte  hard drive into India. A 150 megabytes was a big deal back then. The import license took so long to arrive that by the time the license was given, the manufacturer was no longer  selling 150-megabyte drives, it was selling 300-megabyte drives at a lower price. Unfortunately,  because the good had changed, Nilekani had to go back  and apply for another license. Fortunately, he was able to get that one before technology improved and he would have had to apply  for yet another license again.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1xRi5JPDaM
The Solow Model 4 - Productivity,"So all of these restrictions on  how you can combine capital and labor, this creation of monopolies,  featherbedding, the labor unions, pay restrictions on whom  you can hire and whom you can fire, all of these restrictions  reduce the efficiency with which capital and labor  are combined, reducing productivity, and that  has a big effect on GDP per capita. Let's sum up. So let's sum up in terms of  this diagram from Modern Principles, my textbook with Tyler. So the Solow Model pointed us  to physical capital and human capital as the most immediate causes  of GDP per capita. And the Solow Model technical knowledge was assumed to be a public good, was assumed to be available to anyone, and it was basically also assumed  that organization happened automatically.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1xRi5JPDaM
The Solow Model 4 - Productivity,"And we've seen that is not the case. We've seen that although physical capital and human capital are important, that they alone cannot explain  everything about GDP per capita. You also have to look to productivity. You also have to ask  why is it that in some places they take their physical capital  and their human capital and they organize it better,  they organize it so that the output produce is worth more, so that it has a greater productivity. And to answer that,  we've got to look to incentives.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1xRi5JPDaM
The Solow Model 4 - Productivity,"The incentive to organize capital,  to be an entrepreneur, to bring physical and human capital together to be productive. In a lot of places, rules and regulations  and licenses prevent that. In a lot of places also, we have to ask  ourselves even though physical capital and human capital, even when they explain in  a sort of mechanical way GDP per capita, why is it that some countries have more  physical capital and more human capital than other countries. And again,  the model is kind of telling us well, you've got to look  outside the model. It's pointing us towards incentives.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1xRi5JPDaM
The Solow Model 4 - Productivity,"What are the incentives  to accumulate capital? How does the banking system work? How well does the financial system work? Is the financial system regulated so that interest rates, you know,  are artificially held low, so that the incentives  to accumulate capital aren't very high? What are the incentives  to accumulate human capital?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1xRi5JPDaM
The Solow Model 4 - Productivity,"If you get an education and you do well, can you earn the return  from that human capital or is it all going to be taxed away? If you bring the human and physical  capital together and you organize it, are you going to get rich or  are your riches going to be taxed away? So again, all of these things  are going to depend upon incentives and incentives are going to  depend upon institutions, things like the rule of law,  open and competitive markets, an honest government,  a non-corrupt government, and so forth. So the Solow Model  is a great way of organizing our thinking about economic growth, it points us directly to  physical capital and to human capital Indirectly we've seen that  they alone are not enough to explain, so we've got to start talking about  organization and productivity. That brings us to  thinking about incentives, and that brings us to  thinking about institutions.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1xRi5JPDaM

O-Ring Model,"Welcome everyone. Today, we're going to be talking about O-ring theory. Turns out O-ring theory has  implications for development, but also has implications for the industrial organization of developed economies, that is, for how firms and workers are organized -- when maximizing the value of production requires that we work as a team. O-ring theory is also going to have implications for our understanding of inequality. Let's take a look.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKkOmIW9bjg
O-Ring Model,"The O-ring theory of development is primarily due to a very creative economist  called Michael Kremer. Now, we're going to call O-ring production or an O-ring production function -- if the production task has the following attributes: It's going to depend upon completing a series of tasks. Moreover, failure at any one of these tasks is going to reduce the value of the entire product, perhaps to zero. So, this is the weakest link problem. One weak link in a chain destroys the entire value of the chain.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKkOmIW9bjg
O-Ring Model,"It's also going to be the case, with an O-ring production function, that we can't substitute quantity for quality. I'll come back to that in a minute. Let me give you some examples: Take microchips. A single spec of dust on a microchip run ruins all of those microchips. Or think about a souffle.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKkOmIW9bjg
O-Ring Model,"To make a souffle, you've got  to get the ingredients right, you've got to get the temperature right, you've got to take the souffle out of the oven at just the right time. Mess up on any one of these tasks and the souffle will collapse. What about a musical? To make a great musical, you're going to require an excellent lyricist, a wonderful composer, a great director, superb performers. You need an entire team -- and the talents of that team must all come together at the right time, at the right place.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKkOmIW9bjg
O-Ring Model,"Notice what we mean here by: You can't substitute quantity for quality. Two mediocre chefs are not going to be better at making a wonderful souffle -- than one great chef. For a musical, -- if you don't have Stephen Sondheim, -- then you can't replace him by saying, ""We'll add three, or four, or five,  or more mediocre composers, to make up for the fact that we don't have one great composer"". It doesn't work that way. Now, why do we call this O-ring production?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKkOmIW9bjg
O-Ring Model,"Well, as you probably know,  this is due to the destruction, -- the explosion of  the Challenger space shuttle. As famously shown by  the physicist Richard Feynman, -- the mayor cause of that explosion  was the failure of a very simple product, a failure of the O-ring to expand because it was too cold. So, this cheap really  inconsequential product; it was only worth, you know,  ten dollars or something like that; because it didn't expand  at the right time, because this one piece of the puzzle didn't work right, the entire spacecraft along  with seven people was lost. So, that's O-ring production. Let's formalize this model a little bit.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKkOmIW9bjg
O-Ring Model,"Assume that there are N tasks, one worker per task. Doesn't have to be that way, but simplifies things. We're going to let qi be  the quality level of worker i or task i. So, qi equal to . 9; this can be interpreted in different ways but an easy interpretation is to think that -- . 9 means there's 90% chance  of completing the task perfectly and a 10% chance of complete failure.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKkOmIW9bjg
O-Ring Model,"It could also mean, -- there's a 50% chance of  completing the task perfectly -- and a 50% chance of  reducing the value by 20%. That is, 1/2 times 1 plus 1/2 times . 8, reducing the value of the entire product by 20% equals . 9. So, there are different ways of interpreting these quality levels.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKkOmIW9bjg
O-Ring Model,"Output is going to equal  the number of tasks -- times the quality level in each task, -- all multiplied together. So, this is really the key to the model, to multiply these quality levels in each task altogether. So, for example, -- if there are ten tasks -- and the quality level of  every worker is point . 99, -- then output will be equal to 10 times . 99 to the power of 10 -- or 9.04.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKkOmIW9bjg
O-Ring Model,"So, notice that if each worker were perfect, at a equality level of 1, then the output would be 10, because each worker has  a 1% chance of messing up, -- the output of  the expected output is 9. If the quality level of  the workers went down to . 95, notice that the output would fall to 6. So, just a small decrease in the quality level -- decreases the output by a lot. If the quality level went down to .",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKkOmIW9bjg
O-Ring Model,"9; -- again, not that big a drop; the output level goes down to 3.5, -- an awfully big drop in output for a relatively small drop in the quality level. One of the most important  implications of the O-ring model is that we'll have quality matching. That is, output will be higher if we put all the high-quality workers together and all the low quality workers together compared with if we mixed the workers up. Let's do a simple example. Suppose we have two high-quality workers  and two low quality workers.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKkOmIW9bjg
O-Ring Model,"If we put the high-quality workers  together in one firm, then the output we get is 2 the number of tasks times qh times qh or 2qh quared. The low quality workers then are  2ql squared for the same reasons. If we mix, we then have again two firms. In one firm we get 2 the number  of tasks times qh times ql and same thing for the second firm. Okay.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKkOmIW9bjg
O-Ring Model,"Which one of these is bigger? Well, we can get rid of the 2s. That gives us qh squared plus ql squared compared with getting rid of the 2s here; we still have 2qhql. Which one of those is bigger? Let's just put into numbers.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKkOmIW9bjg
O-Ring Model,"So, suppose that qh is 1 and ql is 1/2. Therefore, for the match group, we get 1 squared plus 1/2 squared, and for the mix group  we get 2 times 1 times 1/2. Let's see. Well, that's a quarter, one and a quarter for the match group and just one the mix group. Therefore, you won a match.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKkOmIW9bjg
O-Ring Model,"What about other examples? Okay, let's do a general proof. If qh is bigger than ql, then notice that qh minus ql squared is certainly bigger than 0. Well, just using FOIL,  multiplying these out, we get qh squared plus  ql squared minus 2qhql. Let's put the 2qhql on the other side, we get qh squared plus ql squared is bigger than 2qhql.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKkOmIW9bjg
O-Ring Model,"But notice that this is just exactly  our statement here for comparing the match output with the mix output. So, this tells us that,  for any qh and any ql, the match output is bigger  than the mix output. Now, it's not too hard to show that in a competitive economy, with quality matching, higher output is going to mean higher wages. So, remember now that the effect  of quality on output, which we now know, is going to be the same as  the effect of quality on wages this is highly non-linear. So, if all the out-workers  have a quality level of 1, then output is going to be 10, up here.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKkOmIW9bjg
O-Ring Model,"Notice that if quality falls  just a little bit to . 9, -- output falls a huge amount to less than 4. So, you get a big drop in quality, big drop in output with  a fairly small drop in quality. Indeed, notice that  if quality falls in half, -- output is basically going to zero. You can't even see in this graph how small output is with a drop in quality of a half.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKkOmIW9bjg
O-Ring Model,"So, what this says is that, -- if there are differences in  quality levels across countries, then one country may have much, much smaller GDP per capita than the other country even though the quality levels are not that different. A fairly small decrease in  the quality levels of the workers creates a big decrease in wages. We can also this at a national level. There's slightly different way. Suppose the talent distribution is something like this -- on the left hand side, that is, most of the workers  have a talent level of 1, this is an arbitrary number here.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKkOmIW9bjg
O-Ring Model,"I don't think of it as all being perfect, just think of it as an arbitrary scale. But suppose most of the workers have this talent distribution somewhere around here. Okay? When you map that into the wage distribution, taking into account the fact we have O-ring production, -- what you get is wages,  you get a big right hand tail. You get wages are much more unequal than talent.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKkOmIW9bjg
O-Ring Model,"So, a fairly equal distribution of talent when you map that into the O-ring model, turns into an unequal distribution of wages. So, in particular,  notice that over here, -- there's hardly anybody who has a talent level of 2 or greater. Very very few people in this economy have a talent level of 2 or greater and yet, wages, -- a large fraction of the wages  are going to go to people who have a talent level of 2 or more. So, this shows you how an O-ring model magnifies the distribution of talent -- turning it into a much more  unequal distribution of wages. Here's another implication of the model.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKkOmIW9bjg
O-Ring Model,"In an O-ring model, workers  performing the same tasks -- will earn higher wages in a high-skill firm than in a low-skill firm. So, for example, highest quality secretaries will work with the highest quality CEO's simply because a mistake by one of those secretaries is going to be so much more damaging when she works for a high-quality CEO than for a low quality CEO. Apple. They'll hire the best programmers and the best designers. They'll also want to hire the best janitors and they'll pay them the most, at least to the extent that the output  of those janitors contributes to the output of the entire product.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKkOmIW9bjg
O-Ring Model,"The same idea applies with the economy as a whole. High-quality workers will be paid more when there are more high quality workers to work with. Talent likes to work with other talent. There's a multiplier effect here. The more high-talented, high-quality workers you're surrounded with, -- the more your earnings are going to be.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKkOmIW9bjg
O-Ring Model,"That's one reason I like to work with Tyler. It's not just; -- we have to take a longer picture view of this as well; -- is when there's a lot of  high-quality workers around, it pays you to invest in being a high-quality worker. Similarly, if there's just a lot of low-skill workers around, it doesn't pay you to be  a high-quality worker. So, if we think about a very smart  person in a poor country surrounded by low quality workers, that person isn't going to earn a lot. They, in fact, may not want  to invest in an education, or in building up their skills because the skills won't pay very much when they don't have those people  to work on their team, -- when they can't combine  with other high-quality people, when they can't get that high pay-off which comes with multiplying  high quality by high quality.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKkOmIW9bjg
O-Ring Model,"This indicates that, in this model, there's a potential for multiple equilibrium. You can have a high-quality -- equilibrium where everyone  wants to be high skilled, but you could also have for the exact the same people, for exactly the same people, you might also end up in a low quality equilibria where no one is getting high skilled and no one thinks it's worthwhile to become a high-skilled worker. In an O-ring model, -- capital wants to work with high-quality workers for exactly the same reasons that high-quality workers want  to work with each other. In particular, note that -- more capital in these models doesn't substitute -- for lower-skilled workers. So, if you give me a Stradivarius, I'm not going to be  a better violin player.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKkOmIW9bjg
O-Ring Model,"You don't want to do something like this, therefore, you don't want to have Homer Simpson running the nuclear power plant. This a failure of quality matching. Don't do that. Instead, what you want to do is you want to match the best workers with the most expensive machines. So, what you want Itzhak Perlman  with a Stradivarius.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKkOmIW9bjg
O-Ring Model,"Implication of this -- is that poor countries  will have more workers in less capital intensive primary productions, so, for example, agriculture. This force magnifies all the other forces  we're talking about earlier. So, in particular, -- capital is going to flow away from countries which have low-skilled workers could want to go to countries  which have high-skilled workers. This means that -- you're going to have lower income and wages in countries with low-skilled workers. This magnifies all the effects we're talking about earlier.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKkOmIW9bjg
O-Ring Model,"Similarly, poor countries will have more workers in production tasks or production jobs that are simpler, -- that require fewer tasks. Let's take a closer look at this. So, what we're showing here  is three jobs scaled so that you get the 100% of output when  the workers are perfectly high quality. Job 1 requires the workers  to get 5 tasks right. Job 2, that they get 10 tasks and Job 3 that they get 40 tasks right.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKkOmIW9bjg
O-Ring Model,"Now, here's point. If you take workers of  reasonably high skilled level, . 9, but you assign them to a job which requires that they get 40 things right, where getting 1 thing wrong, one of those tasks wrong can reduce the value of the entire product, -- then your chances of getting  full output are virtually nil. On the other hand, -- if you take those same workers  and you assign them to a job which requires that  they just get 5 things right, then your chances of getting  full output are much higher. So, think about this as being bicycle production, car production and space shuttle production.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKkOmIW9bjg
O-Ring Model,"What it says is that countries with lower-skilled work forces; they're going to specialize in things  like bicycle production -- which tend to be lower paid. The value of the entire product  tends to be lower when the number of tasks required is lower. What this also says is that, -- if you have a job requiring  a lot of tasks, -- like a space shuttle, where you've got to get  even hundreds of tasks right in order to get the full  value of the product. Then you really want to be working with workers of the very highest skill level to have any chance of producing that high-quality product. We can apply many of these ideas at the level of the economy as whole, in which case it becomes  a theory of bottlenecks, linkages and complementarities.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKkOmIW9bjg
O-Ring Model,"So, let's think about N industries  each performing a single task. In following Kremer, -- let's suppose the quality falls by half in just of these tasks or industries. So, for example, the electricity production becomes  more spotty and subject to blackouts. Corruption increases  at the licence bureau requiring us to spend  a lot more to get a licence. Well, even though, quality has fallen in just 2 of the many tasks which we need to complete, output is going to fall immediately by 75%.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKkOmIW9bjg
O-Ring Model,"Moreover, there are going to be knock-on effects. Wages in every other sector of the economy are also going to fall because the total value  of the product has fallen. And this fall in wages is going to greatly reduce the incentive to invest in quality  in all those other sectors and that reduces output  further in the long run. So, you could have a bottleneck, and a bottleneck affects not just that sector of the economy, but every other sector of the economy. Because you have complementarities, when one sector goes down, the other sectors also go down as well.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKkOmIW9bjg
O-Ring Model,"This shows, by the way,  the importance of trade as a method of avoiding those bottlenecks, of rooting around bottlenecks. If you can import  a fairly high-quality good, perform just a few tasks in country, and then export that good, then you can root around the bottleneck and get some development even when not every sector in your economy is working well. If, instead, you've got to produce  everything in house, everything in the country, then you need every sector in that economy to be working well when you're working  with O-ring production, because you have all  these complementarities across industries. Okay, let's give some final thoughts about O-ring production. First, -- not every industry is an O-ring industry, but, perhaps in our modern world, more industries are moving in this direction.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKkOmIW9bjg
O-Ring Model,"That tells us something about  the sources of growing inequality. O-ring production also reminds us that production is complex, that production often requires that  every member of a team be working in the same direction like a sports team. Every member has got to be performing at their highest level of ability in order to get those wins. This tells us that organizational capital, -- the ability to bring together  high-skilled workers -- with expensive capital, -- and to get all those workers  into that capital working together in a team at the highest level of skill. The ability to do that  is incredibly important, -- and the more complex production grows, the more tasks that are required  to achieve maximum production, the more valuable organizational capital, the ability to bring these workers and capital together, the more valuable  those skills are going to become.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKkOmIW9bjg
O-Ring Model,"In an O-ring model, you can get virtuous and vicious cycles. When one industry in a O-ring  model increases its ability, that increases the incentive of every other industry to perform at its highest level of ability. But the same thing  is also true in reverse. When one team member or when one industry is  performing at a low level, that reduces the incentive  of all the other industries to perform at a high level. Hence you can get growth  miracles and growth disasters.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKkOmIW9bjg
O-Ring Model,"Now, what does it take to coordinate a team? To coordinate an economy  on a high-skilled equilibrium where everyone is working at their maximum level? Well this is an incredibly hard problem. This is all about what culture is about. It's an incredibly hard problem, but also an incredibly important problem, something important to think about.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKkOmIW9bjg
O-Ring Model,Thanks very much.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKkOmIW9bjg
Paul Romer,"Today, we're going to be  talking about Paul Romer. Paul Romer taught for a long time at Stanford University. More recently, he moved to New York University. And he's most famous for being one of the architects of new growth theory, though, more recently,  he's becoming famous for his work in development economics, in fact, for his entrepreneurship  in development economics. More on that soon.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqNRnxUd7E
Paul Romer,"Romer's most famous paper is called ""Endogenous Technical Change"". This is a monumental paper,  a foundational paper in new growth theory, and it has led to a huge outpouring of work in growth theory. We'll be able to discuss the paper in much detail, but let me just give you an essence of where it came from. Let's remember the Solow model. In the Solow model, output is a function of A as ideas, and a combination of capital and labor.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqNRnxUd7E
Paul Romer,"Now, Solow made two assumptions about ideas, A. First, ideas were a public good. They were freely available  to anyone in the world. Second, -- the growth in ideas was exogenous, that is, outside the model. Ideas just kind of accumulated over time. Now, -- in some ways, this was not such a terrible assumption, particularly the first part.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqNRnxUd7E
Paul Romer,"So, a lot of ideas are public good. So, for example, a force is equal to mass times acceleration, the Pythagorean theorem, These are public goods  available to everyone. However, the second assumption is really problematic, -- because growth is about new ideas. And if you look around in the world, most research and development is produced by for-profit firms. Growth ideas are not  coming out of the ether, they're not just arriving magically, they happen in some places  and not in other places, and they happen for a reason.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqNRnxUd7E
Paul Romer,"They happen because, most of the time,  someone is out to make a profit. In developed economies, 60 to 80% of research and development is privately produced by for-profit firms. Now, Solow, however, made  these assumptions for a reason. He made these assumptions because  they made the model much much simpler, because, with these assumptions,  ideas are freely available, they're literally free,  they're not priced. That means that capital and labor  can be sold in competitive markets; they can each receive  their marginal product.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqNRnxUd7E
Paul Romer,"The product itself can be sold  in competitive markets, and the payments to capital and labor will nicely sum up to exactly  equal the price of the product. So everything works out beautifully  with competitive firms when ideas are not priced. However, -- when ideas are priced,  we have a problem. Let's take a look. Ideas are non-rivalrous, and they cannot be sold  in competitive markets because the marginal cost is zero.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqNRnxUd7E
Paul Romer,"So the classic example here  is the pharmaceutical. The first pill costs a billion dollars. The second pill costs 50 cents. That 50 cents that can be produced, the 2nd pill, and the 3rd, and the 4th, and the 5th, -- and the nth pill can be produced  in competitive markets. The 50 cents comes from  payments to capital and labor, which are just enough to cover  the 50 cents cost of the product.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqNRnxUd7E
Paul Romer,"But, -- that doesn't leave anything over for producing the formula, for producing the idea which made -- the pharmaceutical possible  in the first place. So you can't sell pharmaceuticals  in competitive markets, -- because that doesn't leave enough left over to fund the research and development which went into producing the product in the first place. There has to be some monopoly power. Either the monopoly power  maybe comes from a patent, or maybe it comes from  being first to market, or having a trade secret,  or having some knowledge, or being able to do things better than other people do. But you need some monopoly power -- to fund these ideas.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqNRnxUd7E
Paul Romer,"Ideas also create spillovers,  even when you have monopoly power. Well, the patent runs out over time. The idea itself can be copied  not directly but can be -- the idea can still be useful  and still spread around the world. So what did Romer do? But what Romer did is he created  a model of growth based on ideas which were privately produced  by for-profit firms in monopolistically competitive  markets with spillovers.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqNRnxUd7E
Paul Romer,"Now, -- in one way, that's just  following the formula, that's just doing exactly what  we would hope a model should do. But bear in mind that everyone knew  this was kind of the right way to go. Everyone knew this was the right model. But Arrow failed to create this model, Samuelson failed to create this model, Solow failed to create this model. It wasn't until Romer,  that all the knots were tied, that we had all of these characteristics, which we know are true, that ideas are produced  by monopolistic firms, that ideas are really important in growth.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqNRnxUd7E
Paul Romer,"Ideas have spillovers. All of these ideas combined in a model; that was really Romer's, a supreme accomplishment,  in this paper of 1990. Now I said the model was  a real technical achievement. That's true, -- but the really important aspect is that economists often don't start to think about things until we have a model. And what Romer did is he put ideas  at the heart of growth theory.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqNRnxUd7E
Paul Romer,"And once you do that, you start to open up and start thinking  about a lot of new things. Like in the Solow model, it's all about  the accumulation of capital. Once you have ideas  at the heart of the model, you start thinking about things like patents and intellectual property. You start thinking about universities, about capital markets  like venture capitalists and having a capital market,  strong capital market, so that entrepreneurs can take their firms public. You start thinking about human capital, and why we might not have  enough human capital in research, why research might be underfunded, because we get spillovers,  because that's a monopolistic industry.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqNRnxUd7E
Paul Romer,"You start asking yourselves questions about: why do some ideas, how do ideas transmit  themselves across the world? How do they flow across the world? Where do ideas begin? Why does it take some ideas  a long time to transmit and other ideas move across  the world quite quickly? You get a whole new perspective on trade, and the importance of market size as generating the incentives to produce R&D.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqNRnxUd7E
Paul Romer,"You begin to think about differences  in types of ideas like technologies. These seem much more amenable  to be communicated across -- different countries than do rules. Rules, by rules I mean things like: how do people interact? Rules about -- rules like how to create a corporation, how to create honest government. Rules like -- democracy, the rule of law, honest judges, judges separated from politicians, a separation of powers.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqNRnxUd7E
Paul Romer,"Much harder to transmit these ideas  and have these ideas adopted than it is to have ideas about, -- you know, how to create  an engine, for example. You also begin to think about  where ideas are created and what is necessary to create new ideas. You think about cities, -- you think about density, of getting people close together  to transmit knowledge. You think about networks. So all of these ideas about ideas  were introduced -- by the Romer model and put at the center of growth theory by Paul Romer.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqNRnxUd7E
Paul Romer,"So in the late 1980s, Romer had produced a number  of papers in new growth theory, culminating in this great 1990 paper. Many people thought he was  on the track for a Nobel Prize, which he may yet win deservedly in my view. And then something strange happened. Romer disappeared, -- or at least it seemed that way to many people in the economics profession. Romer actually gave up tenure.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqNRnxUd7E
Paul Romer,"He gave up tenure at Stanford. He took an extended  five-year leave of absence from Stanford. To do what? Well, Romer created a startup. He created Aplia -- which, long before it became  the buzzword that it is now, Aplia was the beginnings  of online education.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqNRnxUd7E
Paul Romer,"Aplia was a homework solution. Professors could assign quizzes, could grade all their homework online, could do experiments online in economics. They could shift the demand curve. Students could shift demand curves and supply curves. It was a fantastic, fantastic device, -- and very successful.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqNRnxUd7E
Paul Romer,"Romer ran Aplia for about seven years and then sold it for  a lot of money to Cengage. Aplia is still going strong today. So, did Romer leave new growth theory? Or did he take the lessons  of new growth theory, the importance of ideas, the importance of ideas  to create new ideas, to increase productivity, and did he apply those lessons  to a great startup? I think the latter.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqNRnxUd7E
Paul Romer,"And Romer's story has not yet ended. Most recently, Romer has come up  with a startling new idea for development, charter cities. What is this? Well, let's go back to the problem. The problem is the iron rule of rules.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqNRnxUd7E
Paul Romer,"What I mean by this is  that we saw that some rules, things like the rule of law, things like anti-corruption, things like honesty in government. These types of rules are hard  to transmit. Now, why are they hard to transmit? Well, they may be hard to transmit  because they require a lot of interaction and a lot of coordination. It's kind of like getting everyone from driving on  the left-hand side of the road to switch to driving on the right-hand side of the road.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqNRnxUd7E
Paul Romer,"Everyone must agree to coordinate on the new equilibrium, and that's really hard. There may be forces. You can't you do it, you know,  halfway, in halfway steps, you can't do it a little bit at a time. You've got to go all the way or nothing, and that is very, very difficult. Sweden, by the way, actually  managed to do this in the 1970s.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqNRnxUd7E
Paul Romer,"So in just the same way that  it's hard to get people to coordinate on switching from the right-hand side  to the left-hand side or vice-versa, it may be hard to get people  to coordinate out of the corruption trap. Once you become known, once the rules of helping out your cousin, of helping out your tribe member. Once that rule becomes laid down, a single person breaking from that rule -- is gonna have a really hard time. they're gonna be squashed right back down again. If you don't help out your cousin,  you're gonna be thrown out of the family.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqNRnxUd7E
Paul Romer,"It's really hard to break out  of these coordination traps. So how do you do it? Well, the solution is startups -- or a big push in ideas. This is like the big push idea coming  back to us again, but now it's in ideas. What do I mean exactly?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqNRnxUd7E
Paul Romer,"Well, what I mean and what Romer means is to start up a new city, a new city on unoccupied land, with a charter of new rules. What does he have in mind  for these new rules? Well, he wants the rules to come from outside to launch this new equilibrium. So, for example, you take an unoccupied piece of land in a developed country, and you would turn  that unoccupied piece of land over -- to Canada, over to Great Britain, and have them apply this new set of rules, and then have people  voluntarily enter the city, voluntarily put themselves  under the new set of rules. Hong Kong here is the classic example.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqNRnxUd7E
Paul Romer,"Remember it was Hong Kong, -- which has actually completely  revolutionized China. And that's what Romer is hoping. Start up a new city, create it not only as an end in itself  but as a demonstration project. New city of 10 million people or so  operating under completely new rules. New rules which have been  successful elsewhere, bring them to the new city.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqNRnxUd7E
Paul Romer,"Now, Romer introduced this idea  only in 2010 or so; it's very recent. And yet, incredibly, he's already had some success  in pushing the idea -- around the world. So Honduras, for example,  has indicated that it will create, in fact, has created  this unoccupied piece of land where these new rules  could be put in place. Right now, -- Romer is looking for a third party  to come in and help run the new city. Canada is one possibility.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqNRnxUd7E
Paul Romer,"He's got the judges from outside, also being willing to come in  and apply the new rules. Now bear in mind here; something really important; and that is that the world  is urbanizing at a really fast rate. So take India, for example, it's got 800 million people or so  still living a rural existence. But it's clear,  over the next 20 to 30 years, hundreds of millions of these people  are going to be coming to cities, many of them new cities. So now is a great opportunity -- to create fresh new cities.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqNRnxUd7E
Paul Romer,"Cities not beholden to the old rules. Cities, for example, where caste  would no longer be recognized. That, at least is the hope. Will Romer be successful? Who knows.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqNRnxUd7E
Paul Romer,"But it's a bold idea. He has revolutionized economics education, he revolutionized new growth theory. Perhaps this idea is going to take off as well. Here's a couple of places you can  find out more about Paul Romer, particularly about  this new idea of charter cities. Russ Roberts has an excellent interview at EconTalk.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqNRnxUd7E
Paul Romer,"You can also look at Romer's TED talk. I want to also close with the following. You know, I see Paul Romer  is a lot like Coase, and that Coase didn't write very much. He produced only a handful of papers. But those papers were  absolutely revolutionary, and Romer is the same way.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqNRnxUd7E
Paul Romer,"He hasn't written a lot, but what he has written has been very deep, has been very fundamental, has been much more important -- than most other work which goes on in economics. Indeed, when I think about the economists  which have most influenced me, when I think about the ideas which  I think about most on an everyday basis, which I use to interpret the world, -- ideas which I use to interpret the world, a lot of them about growth theory,  about the importance of ideas, about trade, about markets, they're coming from Paul Romer. So indeed, if you want  to take a look at my TED talk, Tabarrok's TED talk, you'll see that that's really an introduction to the ideas of Paul Romer in many ways. So, thanks very much.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqNRnxUd7E
Productivity in Firms,"Lower productivity in business is one major factor holding back developing economy growth. To give an example,  based on data from 2005, sales per employee in a U.S. firm are over $430,000. Sales per employee in a firm in  the Philippines, shown in this picture, that's about $102,000. In Indonesia, it's $80,000 per employee. In China, it's actually only $66,000, though of course it's gone up since 2005.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvLkFO6PFdE
Productivity in Firms,"The firms in the other countries simply aren't as effective in producing things. Why might that be the case? This is a difficult topic  to get a grip on. Nonetheless, we do know of several factors. First, in less productive economies, typically, lower managers  have less autonomy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvLkFO6PFdE
Productivity in Firms,"This is because they are trusted less, and this makes it harder for them  to implement productivity improvements. So at the same time,  these firms have too much disorder, but they also have too  many bureaucratic rules. In general, there's less  delegation of authority. There are also weaker promotion incentives in a lot of firms in developing nations. Some if this comes from nepotism, namely that family members or friends are in some ways favored or trusted more.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvLkFO6PFdE
Productivity in Firms,"Tying back into that trust issue, there's also a greater fear of managerial theft in a lot of firms in developing nations. There are two other factors which  hold back productivity in these firms. The first is that finance  may be a constraint, especially for smaller firms. This, again, ties back to the trust issue. And finally, infrastructure  is not always as well developed.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvLkFO6PFdE
Productivity in Firms,"For instance, if electricity and water supply are subject to question, this will make the firm less reliable and less productive. In general, firms become more productive when they can grow in size and also when they can decentralize, which gives lower and middle managers the ability and the incentive to implement improvements in productivity, especially when those individuals  operating in a decentralized capacity see a lot of local and specific ways of doing things better which they would like to implement, but without having every time  to get explicit approval from the higher powers in the firm. So what predicts the ability  to decentralize a firm if we look at evidence across  many different nations? Well, one study showed that  there were a few key factors. These included trust, the presence of rule of law in the country, and having a non-hierarchical religion.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvLkFO6PFdE
Productivity in Firms,"By the way, if you're wondering, the hierarchical religions were,  in this study, classified as Catholicism, Islam, and Eastern Orthodox. And finally, having product-market competition in the country correlated with higher productivity in the firms. Those variables were associated with greater firm decentralization as well. This is a topic which economists  are only beginning to research with any degree of accuracy, yet its importance is well understood. For further reading, I would recommend Googling to these two articles.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvLkFO6PFdE
Productivity and firm size,"For developing economies,  a large part of the productivity gap is that too many resources are trapped in smaller and lower-productivity firms. Some of the best research on this topic has been done on Portugal. Now, Portugal isn't a developing nation, but it's one of the poorer nations in Western Europe. A lot of its economic development  has come fairly recently, and it's one of the lower productivity nations in Western Europe. What's striking, when you look at the data from Portugal, is that the average firm size has  been getting smaller for over 20 years.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utyKpBUseWg
Productivity and firm size,"This relationship seems to hold up even if we account for the fact that Portugal now has less  manufacturing and more services, noting that firms  which produce services often tend to be smaller  than those in manufacturing. We also see in Portugal a notable tendency toward greater self-employment. In the late 1980s, about 1% of the Portuguese  workforce was self-employed. Now, it's about 10%. Why is this happening?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utyKpBUseWg
Productivity and firm size,"One reason is that Portugal  has very tough regulations and very tough labor laws, some of the toughest  actually in the world. Workers have very much  a protected status there. But this is the thing. Those regulations, for the most part,  are enforced only on the larger firms, not on the smaller firms. So, to avoid these regulations,  firms have become smaller.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utyKpBUseWg
Productivity and firm size,"From a social point of view, this is inefficiently smaller and  it means lower productivity. As of 2012, Portugal is in the midst of a financial crisis. The country could improve  its productivity significantly by eliminating and changing regulations which give this differential advantage to the smaller firms over the larger firms That would boost their productivity. More generally, across  the developing world, differential enforcement of  regulations and laws, keeping firms inefficiently small, is a significant issue behind  productivity and economic growth. To read more on this topic, I recommend this source  which is available online.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utyKpBUseWg
Industrial policy: theory,"I'll consider the theories  behind industrial policy, but keep in mind, there's also a video on the evidence about industrial policy. People use the term industrial policy  to mean a lot of different things. But for our purposes, just think of it as deliberate attempts by governments to subsidize particular industries and firms and pick winners and losers in the process of economic development. The first theoretical argument for industrial policy relates to what are sometimes called knowledge spillovers and  dynamic scale economies. What does this mean more concretely?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD92am1THA8
Industrial policy: theory,"Consider an automobile industry. If a country has a successful automobile industry, this may require that industry  to be a certain size or scale. And in this argument, the government,  by some mix of tariffs and/or subsidies, can help the automobile industry grow to that size or scale. There's also the possibility that  having a successful automobile industry brings knowledge spillovers  for the rest of your economy. For instance, as an economy develops  a successful manufacturing capacity, this may, in the longer run, help the economy get good at  making other and different things.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD92am1THA8
Industrial policy: theory,"A version of this argument is quite old,  and it was discussed extensively, at least as early as the 19th century, and then it was called  the infant industry argument. The claim there is that certain industries are in a sense like infants. They need to be fed,  they need to be coddled, they need to be helped, and eventually they will grow up and be strong and healthy. A second argument for industrial policy has to do with what are sometimes called coordination failures. So, again, let's go back to our example of the automobile industry.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD92am1THA8
Industrial policy: theory,"It could be that, to have  a successful automobile industry, your country also needs an auto parts industry. Your country may also need  an extensive rail network to ship the parts from where  the parts are made to the automobile production plants and so on. But it could be, possibly, that maybe no single private sector individual will move first and build  his part of the network because he sees that the other individuals are not investing. So, in this argument, there's at least potentially a role for the government to have a kind of big push  or big move forward and get everyone on board with the idea that a particular sector is going to grow, and, thus, to help overcome  these potential coordination failures. A third theoretical argument  has to do with what are called informational externalities.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD92am1THA8
Industrial policy: theory,"Again, consider the automobile industry and imagine a developing nation which might have two or three potential automobile producers. Maybe the producer who goes first, is the one who discovers whether or not automobile production  can be successful in that country, but of course the one who moves first also bears most of the risk. So, the one who would move first,  discovers information for a number of different producers. But you could imagine a situation  where each potential producer is afraid to move first and waits for someone else to take that plunge. Arguably, some kind of coordinating policy or subsidy might help overcome this problem  and help get the nation onto a path where it has a successful automobile industry.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD92am1THA8
Industrial policy: theory,"Two of the major theoretical arguments against industrial policy; they're fairly straightforward but they're also fairly powerful. The first we can call  the knowledge problem. Do individuals in a government actually know which are the economic sectors or firms which should be encouraged? After all, these are bureaucrats and they're not necessarily in  the best position to judge what will be a successful  entrepreneurial venture. There are plenty of examples where governments have tried to encourage particular sectors.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD92am1THA8
Industrial policy: theory,"Those sectors turned out to be failures and it was a mistake in the first place that the government was to think that it was the one to know which  sectors really should be advanced. The second argument asks the simple question: Will special interests  corrupt industrial policy? So, keep in mind industrial policy is not generally some kind of objective  fact-finding exercise run by perfectly honest angels in the public interest. Industrial policy is run by real,  imperfect, self-interested and sometimes corrupt human beings. And those human beings  respond to political incentives, they may be caught up in  a framework of autocracy, they may be catering  to special interests, and, very often, industrial policy will be run in the interests of particular corporations  or industrial sectors rather than the nation as a whole.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD92am1THA8
Industrial policy: theory,"If we're talking about problems  with industrial policy, there are also two particular tests to keep in mind. They're called the Mill test and the Bastable test. The Mill test requires that  a protected sector eventually can survive in a pretty  tough world of global competition once government protection is taken away. The Bastable test requires that, industrial policy; it may  involve some costs now, in the form of industrial protection, but over time the benefits  for what you're doing have to outweigh those current costs. For industrial policy to be a good idea, it actually has to pass, usually, both the Mill test and the Bastable test.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD92am1THA8
Industrial policy: theory,"At the theoretical level, two other questions to keep in mind. The first is tariffs versus subsidies. In practice, a lot of industrial  policy consists of tariffs. Tariffs keep out foreign goods and they protect domestic firms. But the logic of a lot of  industrial policy theory arguments actually implies subsidies  would be a better idea.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD92am1THA8
Industrial policy: theory,"But what we get in practice, very often, is tariffs rather than subsidies. And tariffs very often are  worse for domestic consumers than subsidies would be. The second question is  that even if you've decided that some kind of industrial  policy should be done, it doesn't have to mean  either tariffs or subsidies. It could be that the real policy  which is called for, is some kind of promotion of  foreign direct investment, and that could be  through the rule of law, it could be through a favorable  regulatory environment, it could be through a low tax regime. So, the arguments for  industrial policy taken alone, do not themselves decide that  you would prefer tariffs or subsidies over just having more  foreign direct investment.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD92am1THA8
Industrial policy: theory,"This is a complex topic with  a lot of different angles, and I would stress that  this video has only covered a few. For further reading, I would suggest starting with  the two pieces listed on this slide. But keep in mind that really quite a few of our other videos very directly bear on this question. And if you view the other videos on economic growth, the section on trade, any talk of increasing returns, and also some of the videos in  the history of thought section, you'll get a deeper and more  detailed look at this question of: What are the theoretical arguments for industrial policy?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD92am1THA8
Comparative Advantage,"Hi. Today we're going to be  dealing with one of the deepest ideas in economics:  comparative advantage. Comparative advantage is  the theory of trade. It explains why people trade and  which goods people should trade if they want to maximize their well-being. It's actually useful, to understand  comparative advantage, to begin with a false theory, a very plausible  but incorrect theory of trade, namely the theory of absolute advantage.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1MdriPD7pE
Comparative Advantage,"So let's consider a simple model. Let's suppose that labor is the only good  used in production and that we can produce computers or shirts. Now let's suppose that in Mexico it takes 12 units of labor to produce  one computer and again in Mexico it takes two  units of labor to produce one shirt. Now let's compare with the United States. To make it simple, we'll suppose that in  the United States it takes just one unit of labor to make one computer and one unit of labor to create one shirt.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1MdriPD7pE
Comparative Advantage,"Now, from the absolute advantage theory of trade, it should, it may seem obvious that there, in fact, will be no trade  here. It may seem obvious that the United States will out-compete  Mexico on all margins, after all, the United States in this example is much more productive  at producing computers and ALSO more productive at producing shirts than Mexico. So, this is the case where we might think, well, the United States is so much better at producing both  computers and shirts that certainly there's no reason for  the United States to trade with Mexico, its less productive neighbor. That's the theory of absolute advantage. It's very plausible.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1MdriPD7pE
Comparative Advantage,"It's also very wrong. To see why it's wrong, let's take another simple example. Here's a picture of Martha Stewart ironing her shirt. Now, let's stipulate that Martha Stewart has an absolute advantage in ironing. She has an advantage in ironing just like the United States had an advantage in producing computers and shirts in the previous example.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1MdriPD7pE
Comparative Advantage,"In other words, we'll stipulate that  Martha Stewart can iron a shirt better and in less time than anyone else. So, if Martha Stewart has an absolute  advantage in ironing, should Martha Stewart iron her own shirts? And of course the answer here is no. Why not? Well, every hour which Martha Stewart spends ironing her shirts is an hour she's NOT spending doing  something else which is even more valuable, running her own business,  for example, running her billion dollar business.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1MdriPD7pE
Comparative Advantage,"And in fact, in a famous statement, Martha Stewart, because she's  very wise, she said, ""I don't always do all of my own ironing,  even though I wish that I could"". Let's take a little more detail about why  it doesn't make sense for Martha Stewart to iron her own shirts. The most important point to remember is that the important cost is opportunity cost. So what is the opportunity cost of Martha Stewart  of spending an hour ironing her own shirts? Well, it could be  thousands of dollars!",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1MdriPD7pE
Comparative Advantage,"At least! Martha Stewart will be better off if she specializes in producing her television show and then she trades with someone  else who has a lower opportunity cost of ironing. It doesn't make sense for  Martha Stewart to iron her own shirts because the cost of her doing so is devoting her time to something where she's even more valuable, where she's even better, and that is  producing her own television show. So Martha Stewart has a COMPARATIVE advantage in running her business. Or to put it slightly differently, she has a comparative DISadvantage in ironing.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1MdriPD7pE
Comparative Advantage,"The cost to her of ironing is very high, precisely because she is so much more productive at other tasks. So Martha Stewart wants to specialize in what she is most best at, in where she has a  comparative advantage. Other people are almost as good as her at ironing clothes but they're not as good as her at producing her own TV show. So that's why Martha Stewart  shouldn't iron her own shirts. Let's go back now to our previous example of the United States and Mexico.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1MdriPD7pE
Comparative Advantage,"So the key to comparative advantage is understanding opportunity cost. So let's take this previous figure we had from a previous slide and turn it into an opportunity cost figure. So remember what this top figure tells us, it tells us for example that in Mexico it takes 12 units of labor to produce one  computer and in Mexico it takes two units of  labor to produce one shirt and so forth. Okay? For the United States it just takes one unit of labor to produce either a computer or a shirt.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1MdriPD7pE
Comparative Advantage,"Okay. Now, let's begin with an easy case. What's the opportunity cost of one computer in the United States? In other words, to produce an additional computer in the United States, what would we have to give up? Well, in order to get that additional computer, we'd have to take labor from  shirt production and move it into computer production.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1MdriPD7pE
Comparative Advantage,"And in particular, we'd have to take one unit of labor from shirt production and move it into computer production. That would get us one more computer at the cost of one shirt. So the opportunity cost of one computer in the United States is one shirt. Well what's the opportunity cost of a  shirt? Well, the opportunity cost of a shirt,  what you're giving up to produce an extra shirt is one computer.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1MdriPD7pE
Comparative Advantage,"Okay. Slightly harder case? What's the opportunity cost of one computer in Mexico? So, in Mexico, in order to get an additional computer you'd have to transfer labor from shirt production into computer production, okay? But how many units of labor do you need to transfer?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1MdriPD7pE
Comparative Advantage,You need to transfer 12 units of labor in order to get one computer. You're going to have to take 12 units of labor from shirt production. That means how many fewer shirts? Since it takes two units of labor to  produce one shirt and you've got to move 12 units of labor it means that the  opportunity cost of one computer is six shirts. If you need an additional computer it's going to cost you six fewer shirts in order to get that computer.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1MdriPD7pE
Comparative Advantage,"And, going the other way, in order to get an additional shirt you're going to have to give up one sixth of a computer. Okay, so now we have our opportunity cost. And now it's actually pretty simple because what the theory of comparative advantage says, is that you should produce what you can produce at lowest cost. So who here has the lowest cost of producing a computer? The lowest cost of producing a computer is the United States.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1MdriPD7pE
Comparative Advantage,"The United States is the low opportunity  cost producer of computers. Now who is the low cost producer of  shirts? Well, it's Mexico. In Mexico you're only giving up one sixth of a computer to produce a shirt. In the United States you're giving up one computer to produce a shirt.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1MdriPD7pE
Comparative Advantage,"So you'd much rather produce shirts in Mexico where the opportunity cost is lower. Okay. So what we're learning here is that  Mexico ought to specialize in computers because they're the low cost producer of, excuse me, in shirts, because they're the low cost producer of shirts, the  United States ought to specialize more towards computers, because they're the low cost producer of computers. Let's look in more detail. So I'm going to leave some of the details to you actually and some homework questions, which we'll go over in a future video.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1MdriPD7pE
Comparative Advantage,"So question one: Let's suppose that  Mexico and the United States each have 24 units of labor and that they each devote 12 units of labor to producing computers and 12 units of labor to  producing shirts. That will be our baseline scenario. So the question is what is total world production, in this scenario? That's question one. Question two: Suppose that Mexico specializes in producing what it produces at lowest opportunity cost, we just saw that with shirts, and suppose that the US transfers 2 units of labor from shirts to  producing what it produces at lowest opportunity cost, that's computers.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1MdriPD7pE
Comparative Advantage,"What then, is total world production? And finally, can trade make both countries better off? And here what I'd like you to do is to give a concrete example of how many units have to be traded, from where to where, in order to make both countries better off, if that, in fact is possible. So to help you along a little bit, I know that was a mouthful, let's take a look at this in terms of a diagram. To help you along, I want you to fill in these tables.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1MdriPD7pE
Comparative Advantage,"So our basic table from which you are going to draw the information is up here. If both countries have 24 units of labor, half devoted to computers, half to shirts, there's no trade, so production is equal to consumption in this first example, what is production going to be? So Mexico, 12 units of labor in computers, 12 shirts? How many computers, how many shirts? Same for the United States, how  many computers, how many shirts?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1MdriPD7pE
Comparative Advantage,"What's total world production? Then, suppose we have specialization; what's production going to be? So Mexico has zero units of labor in computers, 24 in shirts. The United States has 14 units of labor in computers, 10 in shirts. What is production in each case?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1MdriPD7pE
Comparative Advantage,"What is the total for the world? And then finally, can we with production, with specialization, can we now find a way to have trade which makes both countries better off, and what's the exact, or  what's a exact price ratio in which that trade will occur. We'll take that up in a later video. Let me just finally give you some concluding comments on comparative advantage. I want to conclude with a caution but also a big picture view of comparative advantage.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1MdriPD7pE
Comparative Advantage,"In the two country/ person examples I've been working with in order to explain the theory, everyone is made better off by trade. In larger examples, trade will increase aggregate wealth but some individuals can be made worse off. And that should make perfect sense, after all, if A and B have been trading,  and then because tariff fall, or transportation costs fall, if A starts trading with C, then B may be worse off, even though A, B and C together have greater aggregate wealth. That's just a caution to keep in mind. Now here's the big picture.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1MdriPD7pE
Comparative Advantage,"Comparative advantage: it applies to people, to groups, to countries. It's sometimes called the Law of Association. And it's not only a beautiful theory, it's a very positive and optimistic theory because it says that we all have something to gain from trade. It says by working together we can increase total wealth. Moreover, we can, I like to phrase this in terms of a politically correct slogan: diversity is strength.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1MdriPD7pE
Comparative Advantage,You've probably heard that slogan before. What comparative  advantage adds to this is that diversity is strength when combined with trade. It's trade which turns diversity into strength. That's really the bottom line on comparative advantage. I'll be saying more in future videos.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1MdriPD7pE
Comparative Advantage,Thanks.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1MdriPD7pE
Sources of Comparative Advantage,"Hi. In earlier lectures  on comparative advantage, we assumed that different countries had different productivities in different industries. Today, what we want to do is just briefly fill that in a little bit and explain why productivities might differ in different industries, in different countries. Let's go. The most obvious differences are those associated with climate, or geography, or natural resources.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DT_T3iL0hRM
Sources of Comparative Advantage,"And, indeed, this is how Ricardo first phrased the comparative advantage model, in terms of wine and cloth, with Portugal being better  at producing wine and England having a comparative advantage in producing cloth. So, when we're thinking about  agriculture, or mining, or tourism -- then these differences in climate can create differences in comparative advantage. Bear in mind, however, don't forget, it is comparative advantage. So, Florida may have an absolute advantage both in producing oranges and in producing tourism, but it's comparative advantage may be in producing, let's say, tourism. So, even if Florida is the best place in the world for growing oranges, we might see more tourism there and more oranges grown elsewhere, if Florida has a comparative advantage in tourism.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DT_T3iL0hRM
Sources of Comparative Advantage,"OK, what else? Another advantage created by the fact that -- labor is not internationally mobile -- is that different countries have different proportions of capital to labor or low skill to high skill labor, different proportions of  the factors of production. So, some countries, for example, have a lot of low-skill labor, they have a comparative advantage in producing goods which require a lot of low skill. Other countries have  more high-skill labor, they have the comparative advantage  in producing, aircraft, for example, which requires a lot of high skill. This, by the way, is  the Heckscher-Ohlin model and a lot has been written about this model.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DT_T3iL0hRM
Sources of Comparative Advantage,"Increasing returns to scale  on the division of labor is another source of  comparative advantage. And this one is interesting, because -- it's a source of comparative advantage which may be created by trade rather than existing naturally before trade. And the focus on models with increasing returns to scale came about when people realized that countries which are ex-ante quite similar; they trade quite a bit. So, the biggest trading partner for the United States is Canada, which looks a lot like the United States, don't tell the Canadians that, but it's true. Developed countries in general tend to trade most with other developed countries.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DT_T3iL0hRM
Sources of Comparative Advantage,"Theory of comparative advantage says, âOh, that's a little bit odd  because you want to trade with countries that  are different than you not with countries  that are the same as youâ. So, how does increasing returns explain that, -- the fact that countries which are quite similar trade a lot? Well, by specializing, countries can increase the productivity. They become ex-post different, after they specialize they become different and then they can trade based upon those increases in productivity. So, for example, -- in the world we don't need every single country to have it's own automobile plant, to have it's own set of automobile producers.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DT_T3iL0hRM
Sources of Comparative Advantage,"It's better to specialize in one, or two, or half a dozen countries producing automobiles, -- because you get economies of scale. It becomes cheaper to produce  automobiles per unit the more automobiles are produced. So, by specializing, one country  produces automobiles, another country produces aircraft, another country produces computerized chips. By specializing, countries can take  advantage of economies of scale, they then become more productive in one good or a set of goods, and they trade for the other goods that they want. So, it's still comparative advantage, but it's comparative advantage created afterwards, -- in order to take advantage  of increasing returns.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DT_T3iL0hRM
Sources of Comparative Advantage,"And, in these models, what you can show is that you get lower costs  and greater variety. Paul Krugman won a Nobel prize, in part, for his work on these models and later, I'll point you  towards his Nobel prize lecture. What else? When we think about increasing returns to scale, we typically think about a big dam, or we think about a huge auto plant which is able to take advantage of robots the bigger it gets, or giant agricultural farms and so forth. But, it's important to realize  that increasing returns to scale could also refer to the division of knowledge, that is, as people specialize, they become more knowledgeable about an area -- and that is what increases their productivity.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DT_T3iL0hRM
Sources of Comparative Advantage,"So, think about physicians. We don't simply have generic physicians. We have heart surgeons,  we have brain surgeons, we have podiatrists,  specialists in the feet, we have specialists in  the ear, nose, and throat, we have cancer specialists,  diabetes specialists. So, by dividing knowledge among  many different brains, we get a vast increase in productivity. So, the examples I've given are more about interpersonal division of knowledge, increasing returns to scale and trade, but this also happens  across countries as well.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DT_T3iL0hRM
Sources of Comparative Advantage,"Different countries or different regions within a country specialize in different areas. Hollywood, for example, Silicon Valley. Dalton, Georgia is the world's  leading producer of carpets because you have a lot of  specialized knowledge in that region. That's what makes them productive, the specialization of knowledge, not so much that they have giant factories, but they have smart people, people who know a lot. Institutions can also generate comparative advantage.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DT_T3iL0hRM
Sources of Comparative Advantage,"So, for example, some countries have more labor market flexibility than do other countries. Countries with a lot of flexibility, so where they can take workers  from one area of the economy and move them quickly into  another area of the economy. They tend to specialize more  in high value products, but for which there is a lot of variability, a lot of variability in demand, for example. Another example is finance. Some countries have better banking structures.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DT_T3iL0hRM
Sources of Comparative Advantage,"If you're going to need a lot of finance, then you're going to want to be in a country like the United States where you can easily raise a lot of capital. It gives a big comparative advantage  to the United States in production which requires huge amounts of capital. Contract enforcement. In some countries, it's very difficult to enforce contracts. So, they're going  to specialize in production which doesn't require  a big division of labor, a big division of knowledge, which can be done all within  one family or within one firm, smaller firm or where  you require less contracts.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DT_T3iL0hRM
Sources of Comparative Advantage,"If you require a greater division of labor over more firms, over more parts of the country,  over more people, you're going to want to be in a country which has better contract enforcement. So, for all of these reasons, these are all sources  of comparative advantage. So, here are some further resources -- on Ricardo's theory of comparative  advantage, on factor proportions. Here's Paul Krugman's Nobel prize lecture, which is quite accessible and I recommend it. You'll also see it in  our list of lectures.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DT_T3iL0hRM
Sources of Comparative Advantage,"OK, thanks very much.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DT_T3iL0hRM
Development and Trade: Empirical Evidence,"Whether trade promotes growth used to be a very controversial question. It's less so today, I think, in large part because of the development of better empirical evidence, and that's what  we're going to look at now. Here's a graph we showed earlier, which shows that GDP per capita in landlocked nations is much lower than in nations  which have access to the coast. And, indeed, if you take  a look at the landlocked nations, among them are some of  the poorest countries in the world like Rwanda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. There's a few rich countries,  Austria and so forth, but they tend to be the exceptions.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyD5sNVfmig
Development and Trade: Empirical Evidence,"Being landlocked is bad for growth. Now, that's important because it tells us something about policy. Being landlocked is something like having high tariffs. It a sort of natural experiment  in having high tariffs. Here's Henry George, a famous  19th-century proponent of free trade.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyD5sNVfmig
Development and Trade: Empirical Evidence,"Echoing a statement,  I quoted earlier from Adam Smith, Henry George says, ""If to prevent trade were to stimulate  industry and promote prosperity, ... then the natural protection  to home industry offered by rugged mountain-chains, by burning deserts, or by sea is too wide and tempestuous for the frail bark  of the early mariner, would have given us  the first glimmerings of civilization and shown its most rapid growth. But, in fact, it is where trade could be carried on that we find wealth first accumulating and civilization beginning. It is on accessible harbours,  by navigable rivers and much-travelled highways that we find cities arising  and the arts and sciences developing"". So, Henry George is saying it's not places which have natural tariffs, which have a lot of growth and wealth, it's places which have  naturally low tariffs. So that tells us something about policy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyD5sNVfmig
Development and Trade: Empirical Evidence,"Here, in fact, is a graph showing  countries between 1965 and 2000, and they've been labelled according to their tariff barriers,  their non-tariff barriers, interventions with the exchange rate, and other factors determining  how open they are, policy factors. And what it shows is that,  average GDP per capita, in countries which were always  closed during this time is much lower than in countries  which were always open. And, indeed, the more open the countries, the higher was GDP per capita. So this is an equivalent to ... our natural tariff barriers,  our mountain ranges also showing the same relationship with tariff barriers,  with our policy choices. More open economies tend  to have higher GDP per capita.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyD5sNVfmig
Development and Trade: Empirical Evidence,"Now, these kinds of results  have been questioned because they don't control for other factors. Maybe there's something different  about open economies and it's not due to trade,  but due to something else which makes them have high GDP per capita. So let's take another look at a different approach to this problem. Here from a paper by  Wacziarg and Welch is a graph showing growth rates  before and after major changes in trade liberalization. These are taken over 50 years or so from many different countries, over different time periods.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyD5sNVfmig
Development and Trade: Empirical Evidence,"And what you see is that, ... after liberalization, you see  a much higher growth rate, in fact, 1.5 percentage points higher than before liberalization. Also, notice by the way, the liberalization is often preceded by a number of bad years. So, crises, is often what it takes  to generate reform, but when you do get reform,  you get a big increase in growth rates. That's really a quite stunning increase. A 1.5 percentage point increase in growth rates after major increases in liberalization is a really important change.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyD5sNVfmig
Development and Trade: Empirical Evidence,"James Feyrer, another economist,  has looked at the influence of trade through the use of  a great natural experiment, the closing of the Suez Canal. So because of the Six-Day War between  Israel and Egypt, Syria, and Jordan, Egypt very quickly closed  the Suez Canal in 1967. It was closed for eight years until 1975. And in fact, Egypt closed  the Canal down so quickly that fifteen cargo ships were actually trapped within the canal for eight years. Amazing.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyD5sNVfmig
Development and Trade: Empirical Evidence,"Now, the Suez Canal  greatly reduced the distance between some pairs of countries, but had little or no effect  on other pairs of countries who had access to either a trade route which is at least as good as the Suez Canal or, in fact, was better  than the Suez Canal. So what Feyrer does is he looks at  what happens to trade, what happens to income  in those countries in those pairs of countries, which were most affected by  the closing down of the Suez Canal. So another way of thinking  about this is that ... the closing of the Suez Canal was like an exogenous increase, like a random increase in tariff barriers. It was if you picked from a handful of countries  and you just said randomly, ""Okay, you guys are going to have much larger tariff barriers for the next 8 years; let's look at  what happens in your countries"". So, it's a natural experiment  in raising tariff barriers because increase in the distance  which ships have to travel is really the same as  raising those tariff barriers.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyD5sNVfmig
Development and Trade: Empirical Evidence,"So, what Feyrer finds indeed is that the closing of the Suez Canal had a big effect,  reducing trade in some countries. And in those countries where it had the biggest effect, you also saw very significant  decreases in income. So, a very nice natural  experiment showing that decreases in trade decrease income. Perhaps the most important piece of evidence, which has convinced most economists that trade is good for developing countries, comes from China and from India. So, China was a terribly  poor country in 1978, which is when they opened up to foreign trade.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyD5sNVfmig
Development and Trade: Empirical Evidence,"And the rest, as they say, is history. Since that time, China has been  growing at a rate of 10% per year. Absolutely unprecedented  for about 30 years now. Totally revolutionizing  China and the world. Now, a lot of other things that is true were going on in 1978.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyD5sNVfmig
Development and Trade: Empirical Evidence,"Mao was dead, they improved property rights,  particularly in agriculture, and they began to free up their economy on many different margins. Nevertheless, it's clear  that without trade, China would not have been able to grow ... nearly as much as it has. The story is also quite similar for India, beginning a little bit later, in 1991, with the liberalization of trade, and, again, after that, growing at a rate of 6% per year. Tremendous, tremendous growth for a country which was simply not used  to growth at anywhere near that level. What's also interesting is that  China has traded goods and India, speaking broadly,  has traded services.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyD5sNVfmig
Development and Trade: Empirical Evidence,"So, these countries, very different countries, one an authoritarian regime, the other basically a democracy  in a developing country. Despite these differences,  both of these countries have managed to benefit tremendously from trade. And these countries  are important because there's over 2.5 billion people  or so between them. So, only two examples,  but very very important examples of the power of trade. Recent empirical evidence  has also taught us more about the sources of growth from trade.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyD5sNVfmig
Development and Trade: Empirical Evidence,"Surprisingly, it's not just  from comparative advantage. So, think about Portugal. In a comparative advantage theory,  Portugal benefits from trade by specializing in wine production and by producing less cloth. But what we're finding is that  countries that open up to trade, both their cloth industry and  their wine industry become more efficient and more productive. So, competition here  is a spur to efficiency, that is, that it pushes prices  closer to marginal cost.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyD5sNVfmig
Development and Trade: Empirical Evidence,"But it also tells firms, ""You better keep up with the cutting edge. You better be productive. You cannot sit back, ... and laze around, and expect  to have a market which can't be taken away from you, because we now have  international competition. Every company has to be on its toes"". So, what happens is that ... efficiency and productivity increase  in both the cloth and the wine industry, and ... you get a shift from  the less efficient producers, the less productive producers to the more productive producers within the industry.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyD5sNVfmig
Development and Trade: Empirical Evidence,"Market size here is  another important variable because the larger the market is, the greater the incentive to invest in improving productivity  and research and development. So, if a country enters  into a free trade agreement, it now has a much larger  potential market for its exports. Those exporting firms, the much greater incentive to invest  in new products, in new ideas, in R&D which is going to pay off  with a much larger market. Investment also increases; I'm going to come back and talk more about that in a minute; and you get inflows of new knowledge; I'm also going to talk more about this. So, let's talk a little bit more about investment.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyD5sNVfmig
Development and Trade: Empirical Evidence,"Here again is Wacziarg and Welch, this time looking at investment ... before liberalization,  trade liberalization, and investment after liberalization. And what you can see is that  there is a very large in market increase, in investment beginning  with liberalization. Looks like a big permanent  increase in investment. Now, there's a couple of reasons why this might be the case. It doesn't follow directly  from comparative advantage, but it does follow with a couple of other assumptions.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyD5sNVfmig
Development and Trade: Empirical Evidence,"For example, as you enter  into a free trade agreement, your exporters get a larger market to which to export. Therefore, it makes sense for them to invest in larger factories, to build more productive capacity. That's one reason. Another perhaps even more important reason is that ... we have to think about free trade,  not simply in consumption goods, but also in investment goods. Free trade may be more important  in investment goods than in consumption goods so what happens with free trade is that the price of investment goods falls.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyD5sNVfmig
Development and Trade: Empirical Evidence,"So with a lower price of investment goods, it now becomes cheaper to, you know, import Caterpillar trucks, for example, or to import computer equipment, or to import new technologies. As those import prices  of investment goods fall, the amount of investment increases, and as we know from the Solow Model, that increases economic growth. Free trade also brings  imports of knowledge, increases in knowledge, and this comes from some pretty obvious but some pretty stunning ideas. So, first of all, most growth is from ideas. It's true, you can increase  your capital stock, you can increase  the quality of your labor, that's important.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyD5sNVfmig
Development and Trade: Empirical Evidence,"But, overall, probably  a majority of growth come from increase in productivity, that is, from ideas. Now, here's the obvious but amazing fact. Most ideas come from other countries. So this is going to be true  for most countries in the world. Most countries in the world  are simply too small to produce a lot of new ideas,  year after year after year.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyD5sNVfmig
Development and Trade: Empirical Evidence,"In fact, by one estimate, the innovations produced three countries: the United States,  which is the dominant one, Germany, and Japan. These three countries account  for more than 50% of the growth in most of the other countries in the world, estimated on the OECD countries. So, more than 50%  of the growth in Australia, Canada, France, Norway, Spain, the United Kingdom, and so forth comes from ideas that were produced in  the United States, Germany and Japan. So there are massive  spillovers in new ideas. Now, the thing about new ideas  is that they're not simply in the air.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyD5sNVfmig
Development and Trade: Empirical Evidence,"Often, new ideas come embodied in imports and in people. Now, how do you get  those ideas to your country then? Well, you import the goods. So when you import high technology goods, that's like importing new ideas. You get to the benefit of  those ideas in your country and by importing the goods, you begin to learn  about those ideas as well.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyD5sNVfmig
Development and Trade: Empirical Evidence,"Same thing with foreign direct investment. So, one of the most important facts  of foreign direct investment is not simply that you're bringing in  money or capital, it's that you're bringing in  people who bring in ideas. And it's in this way, through the import of goods  and through the import of people, which new ideas diffuse  throughout the economy and increase productivity in that economy. So, eventually, what we want is everyone to be  on the world cutting-edge, everybody to benefit by ideas  produced anywhere in the world, and we get there by increasing free trade. This tells us, by the way,  that free trade is going to be especially important for small countries.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyD5sNVfmig
Development and Trade: Empirical Evidence,"The United States can go at it alone. The United States is big enough so that it self-generates  most of the ideas which it uses. But for most of the other countries in the world, they're too small to get the benefit of the ideas. They need and they want to import  ideas from elsewhere in the world, and the way to do that  is to have free trade; not just in ideas. It's not enough to read  the journals from other countries, you got to import the goods  and that's how you get the ideas.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyD5sNVfmig
Development and Trade: Empirical Evidence,"Well, we've covered a lot today and  here are some further resources on geography, on trade liberalization and growth, and distance, the Suez Canal effect,  and so forth. See you next time!",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyD5sNVfmig
Trade and Tariff History,"Let's take a quick look at  some very basic facts about the history of trade  and the history of tariffs. Here are some basic numbers  on the growth and world trade using 2011 dollars as the metric. One thing I find striking is that  when you look at the 1950s and 1960s, just how low trade volume is  compared to contemporary standards. You get the beginnings of  a takeoff in the 1970s, continuing rises throughout the 80s, and then in the 1990s this figure  really moves upward extremely rapidly. Some of that comes from growth  in the developing economies but also a lot of it comes  from wealthier nations trading more with each other.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjrY5VqMU7U
Trade and Tariff History,"You find a significant dip downwards, larger than perhaps had been expected, in the Great Recession of 2008 though, afterward, you can see trade resuming an upward course. Trade is going up for a few reasons. One is that nations, on average,  are becoming wealthier, another is that transportation costs  are falling and that makes trade easier, and a final factor, which we'll look at  more in a moment, is that tariffs and barriers  to trade overall have been falling. Coming from an international  sample of countries, here's data on average tariffs on imports, and, moving pretty much in lockstep, a trade restrictiveness Index. It's interesting, when you look at  the late 19th century, that tariffs are really relatively high.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjrY5VqMU7U
Trade and Tariff History,"One reason for this is that, at that time, countries, in general, did not  have income taxes and tariffs were used as a major  source of funding for governments. Starting in the early 20th century, there's a significant dip in tariffs lasting through the 1920s, and then we find a decade, starting in the 1920s and also the onset of the Great Depression where tariff rates grow  significantly higher, and there's a partial breakdown  in world trade starting in the 1930s. But then in the post-war era, we can see tariffs and trade restrictions on a strongly downward march, and there's a significant move toward freer trade. Here's another trade index  based on tariff rates from 35 countries. One thing you can see here is  a beginning of trade wars in the 1920s.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjrY5VqMU7U
Trade and Tariff History,"You also see the collapse of world trade  during the Great Depression in the 1930s. That's partly from tariffs  but also, in large part, due to the depression itself. If you look at the post-war era, we see a much lower level  of tariff barriers and, of course, that level is falling over time. And note, of course, that this is very good for developing economies and economic growth. If you want to try to grow your economy by exporting to wealthier nations, well, since the end of World War II,  you have been operating in an era where there is a lot of trade,  growing trade, and falling tariff rates.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjrY5VqMU7U
Trade and Tariff History,"All of this has been very good  for developing nations. Just quite a striking graph, it's a look at how inefficient  are the tariffs that we're using, and this is for the United States only. But you can see in earlier periods  of time, say the late 19th century, tariffs and economic terms are  extremely inefficient and they're distorting  economic activity quite a bit. Go back to the point  the tariff revenue was needed to fund the government at all because there was no income tax. In that case, governments didn't have the luxury of trying to find efficient tariffs, they just needed tariffs  which would raise money.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjrY5VqMU7U
Trade and Tariff History,"When you look at the post-war era  and you judge the efficiency of tariffs rather than the inefficiency being up here, or being here, or being up here, we find inefficiency is plummeting  and it's down at this level from about 1950 onwards. So it's not just that  the world has lower tariffs, but it has tariffs which are better thought out or less inefficient than in times past. To read more on this topic,  you could go to a very good paper by Michael Clements  and Geoffrey Williamson; that paper is also the source  for some of these graphs, and you could go to the World Trade Organization website and read their annual reports  for updates on what is going on with trade and tariffs.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjrY5VqMU7U
Trade and Poverty in India,"What happened to poverty in India  when the country moved to freer trade? After independence from Great Britain, trade policy in India turned  in the direction of high tariffs and protectionism. The goal was that things consumed  in India would be made in India. It was even quite difficult to get  a hold of an American Coca-Cola in India during this period. As of 1990, the average tariff in India  was about 80% which, of course, is very high.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXBwPxs9p4E
Trade and Poverty in India,"That meant higher prices  for consumers; for instance, consumers who wanted to buy soft drinks; and it also meant that India was investing a lot of its resources producing goods and services when maybe it wasn't the most  efficient or effective producer of those goods and services. Reform did come to India -- and, in 1991, India started a process of opening itself up to the global economy. So, whereas the average tariff  had been at 80% in 1990, by the time we get to 1996, the average tariff is  at a lower rate of 37%. It's also the case that -- the standard deviation of tariffs  dropped by about 50% during the same time period. What that means is that  those extremely prohibitively high tariffs of about 300% or 400%; for the most part, those were done away with.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXBwPxs9p4E
Trade and Poverty in India,"So, tariffs were both lower and the most extremely high  tariffs were eliminated. In this new situation, India both  imported more and exported more. So, for instance, in the 1980s, -- the ratio of total trade and  manufacturers to GDP was at about 13%. By the time we get to  the year 2000, it's at about 19%, much higher of course. The question under consideration is:  What did this change do for poverty?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXBwPxs9p4E
Trade and Poverty in India,"Well, when we think about how trade affects poverty, there are a few major effects. The first simply is that by being  more open to foreign trade, a country achieves lower prices  by having more competition and by having more access  to cheap imports. A second effect is that by being  more open to trade, a country exports more and this produces jobs at home, and it raises real wages, and it's overall good for the economy. There is, however, a potential negative effect. When a country becomes  more open to foreign trade, its previous businesses,  which were doing well, now have to face more foreign competition.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXBwPxs9p4E
Trade and Poverty in India,"Some of those businesses  will now do less well, some of them may go under altogether, and, of course, that will eliminate  some jobs and also lower some wages. The net effect of trade  on poverty will depend upon how these major effects  and some others all fit together. In most cases in world history, trade has done more to remove poverty, and, when we look at the data for India,  this is exactly the same result we see. For instance, it is found that, for every one percentage point reduction in the tariff rate, there is a 0.57% reduction  in the rate of poverty. If we look at the overall reduction  in poverty across the time period, 1987 to 2004, when poverty in India really  did go down quite a bit, it has been found that 38%  of this reduction in poverty can be attributed to India's  greater openness to foreign trade.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXBwPxs9p4E
Trade and Poverty in India,"That is quite a significant effect. It's not that everyone was better off, but the gains really did  significantly outweigh the losses. To read more on this topic  and to take a closer look at where these numbers come from, I would recommend that  you google to the first source listed. There is also a very good book  by Bhagwati and Panagariya, but that, unfortunately, is  not available online for free. It's called India's Reforms.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXBwPxs9p4E
World Trade Organization,"The World Trade Organization  is a multilateral body which pops up frequently  in discussions of development economics. Let's look at this a little more closely. The World Trade Organization  or WTO, as it is often called, has two primary functions. The first is that it oversees  a series of trade agreements which individual nations sign onto  when they join the WTO. And furthermore, the WTO is  a forum for negotiating disputes, settling disputes, and then enforcing a trade dispute.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmH1wB20_K0
World Trade Organization,"In other words, the WTO is also a court  and it has a kind of police power, namely the ability to levy fines. A typical WTO case involves  the United States and the European Union. The United States has charged  that European governments gave unfair subsidies to Airbus,  the major European maker of large planes, and that this placed the United States company of Boeing at a disadvantage. The initial ruling was in favor of the United States although the case continues and the question now is whether the European governments have in fact stopped those subsidies. In general, WTO cases tell countries they need to lower tariffs, or stop subsidizing their exporters or, in other ways, abide by the rules of what is considered under the agreement  to be some kind of world trading order.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmH1wB20_K0
World Trade Organization,"A few other facts about the WTO: As of 2012, it has 155 members  with a 156th, Russia, on the way. These members include the world's major trading nations. The WTO dates from 1995 but before then something quite similar called GATT,  General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs. And this was constructed in the immediate aftermath of World War II as a way of keeping the global trading order relatively free. Over time, more and more nations  have entered into GATT and now WTO.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmH1wB20_K0
World Trade Organization,"There's the Doha development round  that was launched in 2001, and the purpose of those talks has been to try to lower tariffs even further, but keep in mind since World War II,  tariffs have already come down quite a bit except for the area of agriculture  and getting further gains on lowering tariffs at this point  actually has proven fairly difficult. The WTO is based in Geneva, Switzerland, and there's also a part of it which overlooks intellectual property. And that's called TRIPS which is an acronym for Counsel for Trade Related Aspects  of Intellectual Property Rights. Let's look at some of  the general principles embodied initially in GATT and they have essentially been carried over into WTO. First is the idea of non-discrimination, that a trade break or tariff reduction extended to one nation should,  as much as possible, be applied to other countries as well.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmH1wB20_K0
World Trade Organization,"There's the idea of reciprocity,  namely that countries would mutually bargain for greater trade  and reduction in tariffs. Commitments are considered binding and enforceable and trade policy is supposed to be  as transparent as possible. Note finally that both  under GATT and now WTO, if a trade restriction survives WTO, in some ways, this strengthens that trade restriction because it's shown it's OK  under international rules of order and the clear example here  would be restrictions on trade and agricultural products. Sometimes the very process of  joining WTO can be quite important. The process can take  a long time, 5 years or more.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmH1wB20_K0
World Trade Organization,"And when China applied to join WTO, they had to make a lot of economic and legal changes in order to be eligible. According to one estimate, they had to dismantle at least 7,000 different barriers to trade. Russia, which is now  seeking to join the WTO, is having to reform  its economy in similar ways. These are considered  some of the benefits of having WTO namely that it gives developing nations some reason to move towards freer trade policies. Of course, for the same reason, the WTO has its share of critics.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmH1wB20_K0
World Trade Organization,"Most economists are strong advocates of free trade but not all commentators and observers  agree with this perspective. And those individuals who favor  trade protectionism for developing nations tend to be strong critics of WTO. Over time, the WTO seems to matter somewhat less. The first key point is that a lot of progress in reducing trade barriers today, it comes in the form of bilateral agreements rather than multilateral agreements  for the entire world. So, the United States and  Costa Rica may make a deal.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmH1wB20_K0
World Trade Organization,"The United States and South Korea  or Colombia may make a deal. But these are country to country deals  and over time we've seen more and more progress coming  in that form rather than through WTO. The second point is that the major remaining areas of trade barriers for a lot of countries  are agricultural subsidies and sometimes tariffs, and those seem to be persisting. WTO has not really  been able to crack those. Finally, there's a paper by economist Andrew Rose and the title of his paper is ""Do we really know that the WTO increases trade""?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmH1wB20_K0
World Trade Organization,"And he looked at the numbers and he argued that there's actually an ambiguity here. Most countries are reducing tariffs  and trade barriers over time anyway and it's not clear that joining  earlier GATT and now WTO makes that big a difference. There's been a lot of debate around this paper and economists disagree as to what's the correct statistical model here. But the mere fact that a serious paper could be written challenging whether the WTO  makes a difference at all is here the important point. When you read the popular press,  when you read the critics, you often see a quite sensationalistic treatment of the WTO as if it is some major force ruling the world order and destroying democracy and forcing developing nations to do all kinds of things  they don't want to do.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmH1wB20_K0
World Trade Organization,"When you look at the evidence, it seems the WTO really may have some marginal impact on freer trade,  encouraging countries to join, and encouraging countries to get rid of their trade barriers. But in general, a lot of  the popular discussions of the WTO, especially the negative ones,  have an exaggerated sense simply of how much power the WTO has. By the way, for more information on all these topics, just google the words  on these various slides starting with ""World Trade Organization"". You can also read Andrew Rose's paper.

Property Rights 1: Private v. Collective,"Hi, today we're going to  look at property rights. Particularly property rights and land which are especially important in developing economies. And we are going to examine a very basic shift through historical examples the shift from collective ownership to something closer to or towards private ownership. Let's begin with the basics. Jeremy Bentham summed up the case for property rights when he said, ""He who has no hope that he shall reap, will not take the trouble to sow"".",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AydEQS3sf0
Property Rights 1: Private v. Collective,"What property rights do is they  connect actions with consequences. They connect initiative with reward and indolence with privation or poverty. When those that sow reap the benefits there is a greater incentive to work and to invest In addition, property rights also make it easier to trade rights, to reallocate rights to those who can use them to best advantage. and they may increase the ability to access credit, when you can use property as collateral. Today we are going to be focusing on the incentive the property rights create to work and to invest.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AydEQS3sf0
Property Rights 1: Private v. Collective,"In 1949, the communists under Mao abolished private property in China. And in the great leap forward farmers were put to work on collective farms of up to 5000 families. So in essence what this meant, is that a farmer who put in an extra day of work and who say who produced an extra bushel of wheat he would receive 1/5000 of that bushel. Thus collective rights severed the connection between actions and consequences. They sever the connections between work and reward.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AydEQS3sf0
Property Rights 1: Private v. Collective,"And do to this and due to the host of other mistakes on the part of the Chinese leadership, there was mass starvation. As many as 18 to 30 million people may have starved in China in the worst possible, horrible circumstances. collective land ownership in China wasn't ended by a decree from the top. It was ended by a spontaneous revolt from below. In 1978 farmers from 18 households in Xiaogang Village risked their lives to secretly end land communism.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AydEQS3sf0
Property Rights 1: Private v. Collective,"The Villagers divided the collective land by household. Each household agreed deliver a quota to the government. But they all agreed that they would keep whatever remained. This is their secret agreement which was signed with a thumb print. A clause in the agreement reads, 'If any word about this is divulged, and one of us is put in prison other team members shall share the responsibility to bring up his child till he or she is 18 It was a remarkable agreement,  and it was with this agreement that China's second revolution really began.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AydEQS3sf0
Property Rights 1: Private v. Collective,"Under the household responsibility system of the Xiaogang village, output increased by a factor of six! Now at first the communist bureaucracy tried to shut the system down, but word got out It began spreading to other villages. The bureaucracy saw the success of the system You know Mau is dead, and so  the new leadership decided that they would let the experiment continue And in fact by 1982 the household responsibility system became the official system. And thus China's second revolution had begun. Today, in fact, there is a sculpture in Xiagang memorial hall which commemorates the secret beginning of China's rural reform.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AydEQS3sf0
Property Rights 1: Private v. Collective,"In China this is actually quite a famous story, and the Chinese mark,  this is the beginnings of modern china, opening to the world, opening up of trade, increasing agricultural productivity, allowing people to move to the cities, increasing exports, it all began  with Xiaogang village. Surprisingly, another example of the problem of land communism comes from the early history of the United States. When the pilgrims first landed to Plymouth They set up a system of land collectivization. This didn't work very well,  and soon they began to starve. So Governor William Bradford described what happened next at length.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AydEQS3sf0
Property Rights 1: Private v. Collective,"after much debate of things the governor assigned to every family a parcel of land. In other words the governor ended land collectivization and set up a household responsibility system. Just like in Xiaogang Village.

So as early as 1623, William Bradford,  realizes that to even try to get land communism to work, it's gonna require tyranny, and oppression Moreover he goes on, ""this was terrible for morality. because it made everyone suspicious of one another. When someone was sick for example, people began to wonder, is that person really sick or are they trying to be lazy are they trying to take advantage of other people? It led to resentment and distrust"".",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AydEQS3sf0
Property Rights 1: Private v. Collective,"So William Bradford says, "" Far from collectivism, creating benevolence,  this collective system actually created suspicion, distrust, and resentment. It's a fabulous section on Plymouth plantation, I'll give you  a reference at the end of the lecture. Here's another modern example, Vietnam. Under the French most land in Vietnam was owned by a handful of plantation owners, mostly French, some Vietnamese. After independence in 1954, land  to the north was initially distributed to the farmers.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AydEQS3sf0
Property Rights 1: Private v. Collective,"And that had actually good properties. But the communist quickly reversed these policies and collectivized the land By the mid 1960's most peasant farmers were working on collectives. As in China, Collectivization reduced agricultural productivity. Per capita rice production dropped from 269 Kilograms  in 1961 to just 194 Kilograms in 1975. One farmer really summed up what had really happened with the new system.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AydEQS3sf0
Property Rights 1: Private v. Collective,"Under collectivization, there was no  responsibility and there was no rice. After unification of North & South Vietnam after the Vietnam War, there were further attempts at collectivization in the south. A lot of peasant resistance, not very successful. The system was also not working in the north. And by 1988, millions of Vietnamese were severely hungry, and in famine.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AydEQS3sf0
Property Rights 1: Private v. Collective,"especially in the north. With the country on the verge of mass starvation, the government reversed course and introduced the doi moi or, renovation policies. On April 5th, 1988 Resolution 10 abolished the requirement that farmers perform collective labor. It allocated land to households  and gave them a 15-year tenure. So not pure private property rights, but a much greater security of property.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AydEQS3sf0
Property Rights 1: Private v. Collective,"Open markets were privatized, and investment decisions decentralized. These policies increased output dramatically, and Vietnam became a significant exporter of rice for the first time in a very long time. Under these policies, land, however, could still not be transferred, or sold. 1993 Private property was pushed even further when reforms granted the rights to transfer, exchange, inherit, rent,  and mortgage property. So this required a significant effort to survey, to register, and to title property.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AydEQS3sf0
Property Rights 1: Private v. Collective,"With these stronger rights, which took time to implement throughout the country, farmers began to switch to crops,  requiring greater investment, but bearing higher returns. So fruit trees for example, they began to invest more in fruit trees, which don't pay off, unless  you have future rights. There was also greater investment in irrigation. No significant changes in access to credit, however. So what we see here with examples  spanning many different times and many different places, is that land collectivization has often failed.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AydEQS3sf0
Property Rights 1: Private v. Collective,"This practice has often led to mass starvation and hatred and resentment. Now, sometimes, privatization is not possible. sometimes the commons may be the best that we can do, and there are better and worse ways of managing the commons. we'll talk about that another time. We'll also talk in more detail about how private property is instituted on the ground, about different types of surveying,  systems, registration systems, titling systems, identification systems.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AydEQS3sf0

"Property Rights 3: Communal Property, Enclosure and the State","Today we talk about some issues which are still controversial after 500 years of debate. Namely communal property, Enclosure, and the State I want to begin with a claim from James Scott from his excellent book ""Seeing Like a State"". Scott argues that what we think about as private property was actually a creation of governments. In particular that individual fee simple ownership. The idea of property where one person owns a piece of land and can exclude others.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DGvR97eyz8
"Property Rights 3: Communal Property, Enclosure and the State","That this was a creation of governments who are looking to simplify or to make legible property rights in order that they could better tax, conscript and control people under their jurisdiction. I think Scott is partially right. Not completely right, but partially right. And in order to better understand this we need to better understand historically what has been the alternative to private property which has not been government control, but village or communal property. So lets look at communal property.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DGvR97eyz8
"Property Rights 3: Communal Property, Enclosure and the State","Here from the previous slide is the classic example of private property. Notice that it is fenced, and there's no hunting, no fishing no trapping, no trespassing for any purpose. It's strictly forbidden! Violators will be prosecuted! Notice that this is also posted, it's written down.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DGvR97eyz8
"Property Rights 3: Communal Property, Enclosure and the State","It's legible. The opposite of all this is communal, or village property. And here the key concept is ""usufruct"" rights. Which are rights of non-owners to use, enjoy, or profit from aspects of property. And here Scott gives a nice stylized example.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DGvR97eyz8
"Property Rights 3: Communal Property, Enclosure and the State","Quote ""Let us imagine a community in which  families have usufruct rights to parcels of crop land during the main growing season. Only certain crops, however, may be planted. And every 7 years the usufruct land is redistributed among resident families according to each family's size, and its number of able bodied adults. After the harvest of the main season crop, all crop land reverts to common land. Where any family may glean, graze their fowl and livestock, and even plant quickly maturing dry season crops.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DGvR97eyz8
"Property Rights 3: Communal Property, Enclosure and the State","Rights to graze fowl and livestock are extended to all local families, but the number of animals that can be grazed is restricted according to family size. Families not using their grazing rights can give them to other villagers but not to outsiders. Everyone has the right to gather firewood for normal family needs. And the village blacksmith and baker are given larger allotments. Trees that have been planted and any fruit that they may bear are the property of the family who planted them no matter where they are now growing.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DGvR97eyz8
"Property Rights 3: Communal Property, Enclosure and the State","Fruit fallen from such trees, however, is a property of anyone who gathers it. When a family fells one of its trees, or a tree is felled by a storm, the trunk belongs to the family, the branches to the immediate neighbors and the tops, the leaves, and twigs to any poor villager who carries them off"". End Quote Now this is a stylized example that may represent no particular village. But it's very reminiscent of English village life, before the enclosure system. This type of system would also be well understood even up to recent times by villagers in India and parts of Asia and in Africa.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DGvR97eyz8
"Property Rights 3: Communal Property, Enclosure and the State","Notice how complex the system is, everyone has some rights to some things. This may be very good for insurance purposes. It may be not so good for efficiency purposes as we'll talk about in a moment. Moreover, this system is highly historic. It's based on memory and convention.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DGvR97eyz8
"Property Rights 3: Communal Property, Enclosure and the State","It's not written down. And because of that it's not really capable of being understood by outsiders who don't have access to the historical knowledge and conventions. Scott's point is that when land is divided communally in the way I've just described it's hard to tax people, hard to know how much they can afford. It's hard to find people to identify them. It's hard to control people.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DGvR97eyz8
"Property Rights 3: Communal Property, Enclosure and the State","Rulers would much rather have land divided like this. Because in this case you know how much people can afford. You know where to find people because people can't leave without leaving their land, their livelihood. You can identify people. You know where their homes are so you can conscript them and so forth.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DGvR97eyz8
"Property Rights 3: Communal Property, Enclosure and the State","And Scott is right that rulers, uh, kings and monarchs and colonial governments such as the  Japanese colonial government in Taiwan and in Korea, they often established or try to establish land which was divided in this way. Where I disagree with Scott is in thinking that this was the only reason towards the evolution of fee simple private property in the modern sense. Because in fact there's a lot of other problems with communal property. It's difficult, for example, to take advantages of economies of scale. Who is going to buy the mass combine thresher when he doesn't own the entire piece of land?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DGvR97eyz8
"Property Rights 3: Communal Property, Enclosure and the State","There's little incentive to make major capital investments, for example, in irrigation when the land is owned communally. There's, potentially, over exploitation. This is the tragedy of the commons. This problem, the tragedy of the commons, was limited when you could limit communal life to villages, but, in a modern society where people are moving about, the  tragedy of the commons becomes a real problem. There's also little scope for entrepreneurship and experimentation when to change anything you have to get mass agreements among everyone who may have a right, a usufruct right to parts of the land.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DGvR97eyz8
"Property Rights 3: Communal Property, Enclosure and the State","So it becomes hard to shift resources into higher valued uses. You get gridlock, you don't get experimentation and entrepreneurship when every single villager has the right to block new ideas and new ways of doing things. So there are also efficiency reasons for the evolution from communal property to modern private ownership. The basic idea here is that when resources are more valuable under one property rights regime than under another, incentives are going to exist for a transfer. However, we have to be forthright, the  transfer process is often ugly.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DGvR97eyz8
"Property Rights 3: Communal Property, Enclosure and the State","The Enclosure movement in England, France and elsewhere, for example, in which the common lands were  fenced off. This movement at times was ugly, not always, there were compensations made and majority of people often had to agree in order to fence in the land. Lots of land was fenced in  voluntarily Nevertheless, it is true that during the enclosure movement, common, traditional, long-standing usufruct rights were often abridged. And we see this debate, and we see this evolution being echoed in developing countries today. It's often not a  pretty process.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DGvR97eyz8
"Property Rights 3: Communal Property, Enclosure and the State","Through our increases in productivity, when you shift to new property rights regimes, that also changes in the  distribution of wealth. And sometimes it's hard to disentangle. And here we have to also be forthright in that there's still a big debate over the Enclosure Movement in England and France  and elsewhere. About how much was  efficiency gain, and how much was  distribution. In my view, there was substantial efficiency gain.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DGvR97eyz8
"Property Rights 3: Communal Property, Enclosure and the State","I come to that view from thinking about how this process evolved, not just in England and France but has come across all over the world. We see the same movement all over the world to fee simple property. And I think that suggests that there's an efficiency reason. This is not to deny, however, that there was also redistribution often to the powerful. Lots of other further readings on this topic.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DGvR97eyz8
"Property Rights 3: Communal Property, Enclosure and the State","You could look at, uh, James C. Scott on the state's rule  and creating private property. On the Enclosure movement debate, Donald McCloskey and Robert Allen take opposing positions on the efficiency of that, uh, movement. John-Laurent Rosenthal looks at the French case. Chih-ming Ka looks at, uh, the Japanese case and Taiwan. That's also looked at as well as Korea and other examples by Dongwoo Yoo and, uh, Richard Steckel.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DGvR97eyz8

Corruption and Growth,"The connection between  corruption and economic growth is one of the most important topics though it's a very difficult  set of questions to untangle. The available evidence is difficult  to interpret for a few reasons. First, is low corruption  causing economic growth or is it also that economic growth  is causing corruption? We can find a correlation and  we suspect that the causation runs both ways, but it's very difficult to figure out how much it's corruption  causing growth rather than vice-versa. The second problem  in the data is, it seems, that some kinds of corruption  are more likely to harm economic growth than others.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNf5QY9RXJY
Corruption and Growth,"Yet, the data we have  for corruption or aggregate data. They suggest how corrupt  an economy is overall, but they don't disentangle how much of the bad forms of corruption that economy has relative to  the less harmful forms of corruption. A very general problem is that  if a country is corrupt, it's very likely to offer  bad or misleading data. In fact, the data themselves may be corrupt. This should hardly come as a surprise.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNf5QY9RXJY
Corruption and Growth,"So when we're trying  to rank corrupt countries on the basis of their correctness, sometimes, maybe,  we just don't know. Finally, in some ways, it's at least possible that  a growing modernizing economy will in some ways  become more corrupt. If you imagine a very,  very poor economy, maybe there's just not  that much to fight over, or there's not that much to bribe for. But, as that economy grows, again,  corruption opportunities increase, and you may see at some margins  positive correlations between economic growth and corruption, but it would be wrong to conclude that somehow the corruption is causing the growth. Rather, it's the case that,  possibly, at some margins, some amount of growth makes  some corruption a little bit easier.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNf5QY9RXJY
Corruption and Growth,"In part, we interpret the data we do have through the lens of economic theory, and serious economists who study this area or who work in this area, they believe with virtual unanimity  that corruption really does harm growth. And they believe this because  of a mix of evidence and theory, and, of course, the evidence is viewed through the light of theory. Before discussing  that evidence just a bit, there's one trap we'd like  to warn you against, and that is, it can always  appear that, at some margin, bribery or corruption might be  good for economic growth, but don't be mislead. Let's a simple example. Let's say that, to start a new business, you need to pay a bribe.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNf5QY9RXJY
Corruption and Growth,"You could then say, ""Ah, well,  bribery is good for business,"" and in a very limited sense, of course, that's going to be true, but that's missing the point. The fact that you have to pay  the bride is what's bad for business. So, even though you might  have a mental model or some particular acts of corruption, may quote-unquote ""grease the wheels"", you should not from that conclude that  corruption is good for economic growth. Probably it's not. The most frequently cited paper  on this topic is called ""Corruption and Economic Growth"",  and it's by Park Hung Mo.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNf5QY9RXJY
Corruption and Growth,"He finds a very definite correlation  between higher corruption levels and lower rates of economic growth. He also finds the most  important channel for how growth and  corruption are connected is through political instability. That is, corruption is correlated with political instability and political instability,  in turn, harms growth. It should be noted that this paper, like a lot of other work  in macroeconomics, can't really prove that  these relationships are strictly causal. Another well-known paper  in the area is by Mauro; it's called quite simply ""Corruption and Growth"".",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNf5QY9RXJY
Corruption and Growth,"He shows that corruption is associated with lower levels of investment. And to give an example of the magnitudes, if Bangladesh could be less corrupt, at a level comparable to, say, that of Uruguay, their investment rate  would rise by a full five points. A number of papers on  African economic growth consider the relationship with corruption. Some typical results would be  that corruption is associated with lower growth,  lower per capita income, higher inequality, and that corruption hurts  the poor more than the rich. Really, no one of these papers  would be considered decisive evidence, but when you put  the entire body of evidence together with a very strongly  established body of theory, again, to reiterate, virtually all economists are strongly of the opinion that corruption significantly  discourages economic growth.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNf5QY9RXJY
"Corruption, Rent Seeking and Multiple Equilibria","Welcome, everyone! Alex Tabarrok here. Today, we're going to be looking at rent-seeking and why it's so bad for the economy. Just a note on terminology: rent-seeking, like corruption,  is a nonproductive activity which takes from the productive side of the economy. Rent-seeking doesn't have  to be illegal, however.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgpKxdvYHu0
"Corruption, Rent Seeking and Multiple Equilibria","We can think about creating  a cartel, or a monopoly, or a tariff or a tax. These could all be types of rent-seeking which take from the productive side of the economy and are themselves, unproductive. Rent-seeking would also include theft and other corrupt activities, but is not necessarily itself corrupt. Okay, let's take a look at a model. So our model is based on one created by Kevin Murphy, Andrei Shleifer, and Robert Vishny; three famous economists; in a paper called, ""Why is Rent-Seeking So Costly to Growth""?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgpKxdvYHu0
"Corruption, Rent Seeking and Multiple Equilibria","And the very basic idea is going to be that rent-seeking can drive out productive activities  in a way that is self-fulfilling. It will be a kind of snowball effect. So there will be a good equilibrium  which is stable, but if you hit a tipping point, we're going to show that  you can be driven way down here to the bad equilibrium. And the bad equilibrium is very bad, and once you're down here, it's hard to climb your way back out. It's gonna be hard  to climb your way back out.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgpKxdvYHu0
"Corruption, Rent Seeking and Multiple Equilibria","That's going to be the basic idea of the model. Let's take a closer look. So we're going to have a model  of a developing economy in which there are three activities,  things you can do. First, you can produce a cash crop, that is, produce a crop for market sale. This is where you're going to get money for your crop.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgpKxdvYHu0
"Corruption, Rent Seeking and Multiple Equilibria","We might think, for example,  about producing coffee. This is a productive thing to do, you're going to make lots of money, you're going to be given cash, you're not going to consume  the coffee yourself, perhaps just even for export. The second thing you can do  is to go into subsistence production. You can produce for your own family  or produce a crop that will feed you but has negligible market value. So you can produce potatoes, for example.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgpKxdvYHu0
"Corruption, Rent Seeking and Multiple Equilibria","There's no real market for the potatoes. You're just going to consume them yourself, it's enough to keep you going, keep you in subsistence, but you're not going to sell  these potatoes on the market, you're not going to get cash for them. The third thing you can do is you can go to the capital  and you can rent-seek. You can tax, you can steal,  you can create cartels, and so forth, which enable you to take from the producers of the cash crop. Notice you can take cash -- but you cannot rent-seek  from the subsistence farmers, -- and this is because  it's easier to steal the cash than it is to steal the potatoes.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgpKxdvYHu0
"Corruption, Rent Seeking and Multiple Equilibria","The rent-seekers, they don't even want the potatoes, you know, they want cash, they want money. You can't really take very much  from these subsistence farmers, but you can take from the people  producing the coffee, the cash crop. You can take their money, it's much easier. So it's much easier to rent-seek from the cash crop. The key idea is going to be  the rent-seeking pushes the returns to the cash crop down, -- and in particular, -- the more people who enter  the rent-seeking sector, the lower the returns  to producing the cash crop.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgpKxdvYHu0
"Corruption, Rent Seeking and Multiple Equilibria","Okay, let be N the number of rent-seekers and then let's take a look at  what can happen in this model. So our first case is going to be the simplest case: ""the property rights  are well-protected"" case. This will help us to understand  the basic mechanics of the model. Notice on the horizontal axis down here, we have the number of rent-seekers. On the vertical axis, we have  the returns or the rewards -- to the different types of activities  to being a producer, to going into subsistence farming, or to being a rent-seeker, here in red.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgpKxdvYHu0
"Corruption, Rent Seeking and Multiple Equilibria","Now, notice that  if there are zero rent-seekers, then the return to production  is very high, up here. Forget that it says ""Good Equilibrium"" for the moment, just notice that with zero rent-seekers the return to production is very high, and, because property rights  are well protected, the return to rent-seeking is low. So it costs a lot, in this case, to steal money from the productive sector of the economy. Now imagine that the number  of rent-seekers increases. So as the number of  rent-seekers increases, the returns to the productive side of the economy fall.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgpKxdvYHu0
"Corruption, Rent Seeking and Multiple Equilibria","And they continue to fall until  they are equal to the subsistence return. At this stage, people say, ""Okay, I'm gonna leave the cash-crop. So much is being stolen from me,  it's just not worth it anymore. I'm going to go into producing  potatoes instead, subsistence farming"". For the rent-seekers, -- their returns stay constant as the number of rent-seekers increase -- until you hit the subsistence farming.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgpKxdvYHu0
"Corruption, Rent Seeking and Multiple Equilibria","This is because, as you get  more rent-seekers, they can continue -- to take from the cash-crop side of the economy, each one of them gets a chunk of  that cash-crop side of the economy. But once you have people  entering subsistence farming, the return to rent-seekers falls. Okay. Now the equilibrium  in this model is pretty simple, because the returns to being a producer,  the rewards to being a producer, exceed the rewards to rent-seeking. There is no reason to be a rent-seeker, so everybody ends up being a producer, and you end up here, in the good equilibrium.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgpKxdvYHu0
"Corruption, Rent Seeking and Multiple Equilibria","This is the good case, the great case. Everyone is working in the most productive sector of the economy, the cash-crop sector. We don't have any rent-seekers because it pays more to be a coffee-grower than it does to be a coffee-stealer. Okay, what else can happen? Case two, in a way, is the diametrically opposite case.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgpKxdvYHu0
"Corruption, Rent Seeking and Multiple Equilibria","This is the case where property rights  are very weakly protected. So in this case, it's so easy to be a rent-seeker that the returns to rent-seeking exceed the returns to being a producer. As a result, the number of rent-seekers increases and continues increasing -- until we reach the bad equilibrium. So what happens here is you get more and more rent-seekers, -- the returns to the productive side of the economy fall until you reach the subsistence return. Then, you still get more and more people entering the subsistence economy until the returns to rent-seeking  equal the returns to subsistence, which equal the returns  in the cash sector of the economy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgpKxdvYHu0
"Corruption, Rent Seeking and Multiple Equilibria","So here we may have  all three sectors operating. The rent-seekers are taking  from the cash sector of the economy leaving the people in the cash sector with just the subsistence return. There's no incentive for people in the cash sector any longer to switch to subsistence farming. because subsistence farming is paying the same return. Also, there's no incentive  to go from potatoes to coffee because, again, you get the same return.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgpKxdvYHu0
"Corruption, Rent Seeking and Multiple Equilibria","There's also no more incentive  to enter the rent-seeking sector because they have driven  the economy to such a low level that everyone is making the bad return. Nobody, whether they're  in the cash crop sector of the economy, the rent-seeking sector,  or the subsistence sector, nobody is making a good return, everyone is making the potato return, the subsistence return. This is the bad equilibrium. And here we have the third case, which is perhaps the most interesting. In this case, if you don't have  very many rent-seekers then everything is okay because -- the returns to being a producer exceed  the returns to being a rent-seeker and you end up in the good equilibrium.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgpKxdvYHu0
"Corruption, Rent Seeking and Multiple Equilibria","However, suppose that for random reasons, perhaps there's a war,  perhaps there's some kind of shock, we get an increase in rent-seeking. If we get an increase  in rent-seeking enough which pushes us over this tipping point, then, all hell breaks loose. Because, if we push  over the tipping point, the returns to rent-seeking will  exceed the returns to being a producer, and very quickly we're gonna be  driven down here to the bad equilibrium. Also, notice that if you get  into the bad equilibrium, it can be really hard  to get back out again. You've really got to reduce  rent-seeking a lot, get rid of a lot of rent-seekers,  transfer all of these rent-seekers -- back into the productive side  of the economy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgpKxdvYHu0
"Corruption, Rent Seeking and Multiple Equilibria","That's gonna be difficult,  it may require -- very strict changes in the laws,  very tough changes in the laws -- because if you make just small changes, okay, you reduce ease of being  a rent-seeker just a little bit. Well, then, the rent-seeking returns are going to be bigger than the returns in the productive sector of the economy and you're gonna be driven  back to this bad equilibrium. We've got so many people  in that sector of the economy, it's hard to get them all out, to switch them in a big push to get you back into the good equilibrium. I also think about this part of the model as being a little bit like  the Atlas Shrugged model. So in Ayn Rand's novel,  ""Atlas Shrugged"", -- the rent-seekers are getting  more powerful over time, ""the looters and the moochers,"" as Ayn Rand would have put it, are getting more powerful.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgpKxdvYHu0
"Corruption, Rent Seeking and Multiple Equilibria","You're getting all these laws so that kind of this curve  is shifting up like this -- putting you closer and closer to the tipping point,  getting that tipping point closer and closer  until finally you tip over and you end up in the bad equilibrium,  where all the good guys now, all the entrepreneurs, the people who  were creating all of the wealth, they end up going to Galt's gulch. They end up leaving the economy. So you can also think about the subsistence return as not being the potato sector,  but you could think about the productive sector being  the innovative sector, the high-tech, innovative  and advanced sector, the new sector, new-ideas sector, and the subsistence return as being the less entrepreneurial,  the non-entrepreneurial sector. And, as the rent-seeking goes up,  as you get more and more rent-seeking, you may hit that tipping point and then people leave,  the entrepreneurial sector; they leave entrepreneurship, they go to Galt's Gulch or they become ordinary workers, and you get into the bad equilibrium. This model has another -- interesting aspect.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgpKxdvYHu0
"Corruption, Rent Seeking and Multiple Equilibria","Suppose that, the returns  to being a producer go up. So perhaps, coffee prices go up, or perhaps there's  a greater technological change, there's more innovation, and that increases the returns  in the productive sector of the economy. Well, notice that that pushes  the tipping point way far to the right, it pushes you beyond, perhaps, where you're going to get for random reasons. So this says that -- an increase in economic growth  or an increase in the productivity of your export sector, your coffee sector, your cash sector, this actually has two good things to it. First of all, just because it means  higher returns that's better, but also, -- good times means it's easier  to keep the rent-seekers at bay.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgpKxdvYHu0
"Corruption, Rent Seeking and Multiple Equilibria","Simply by raising the return  in the productive side of the economy, you reduce the return  from being a rent-seeker. So it's kind of a double benefit. There's a political benefit  as well as an economic benefit. This is why you typically notice that  when things are good, they're very good. So when the economy is booming,  you often have good politics.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgpKxdvYHu0
"Corruption, Rent Seeking and Multiple Equilibria","On the other hand,  when the economy falters, when the returns  to being a producer fall; -- so we have a situation more like this, those returns to being a producer fall; -- then you even get the worst of all. The economy falls at the same time  you get more people into rent-seeking. So the bad times are really bad, the good times, however, are really good. Another way of putting that is  you want to make sure that your rent-seeking returns are always low, because you don't want to fall into that tipping point, because it will be really hard to get back, and if the good times get a little bit worse, do get worse, for some random reason, you want to make sure you don't fall over that tipping point. So you've got to keep those rent-seeking returns -- low at all times.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgpKxdvYHu0
"Corruption, Rent Seeking and Multiple Equilibria","Okay, let's sum up. So here are three cases:  the strong-property-rights case, the weak-property-rights case, and, really, the one which we're in,  the multiple-equilibria case. And, as we saw, there's lots of good lessons here about staying in that good equilibrium,  keeping those rent-seeking returns low, how good times reinforce good politics, how bad times reinforce bad politics, and the importance of keeping out  of that bad equilibrium. Thanks.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgpKxdvYHu0
Tullock Paradox,"It's a puzzle to many economists why there isn't more spent on  corruption than is actually the case. Just imagine, here you have  a course of government which controls the military  and police force, and it has far-reaching powers  to tax and regulate an economy. It could commandeer a significant  portion of a national output and you might think that, in an equilibrium, the amount of money paid to influence  that government would be about equal to what that government is able to take. But, in practice, that doesn't  seem to be the case. Just to give a simple example, you can imagine, for instance,  that there's an agricultural subsidy worth to farmers, say, $10 million.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-J-l766GEk
Tullock Paradox,"But the bribe or favors required to get  that subsidy from politicians is very often much lower, say, $100,000. So, we're asking: Why is corruption so cheap. One possibility is that voters and citizens simply do not like corruption and they do not like their politicians being too corrupt, or appearing too wealthy, or earning too much money. Politicians, therefore,  restrain their corruption to keep some favor in the public eye. This applies to democracies but  it may apply to many autocracies as well.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-J-l766GEk
Tullock Paradox,"Even though, an autocracy does not allow for explicit honest open voting an autocracy very often cares  deeply about what citizens think because it wants to stay in power. So, autocracies too may be responsive to public opinion in this regard. They are very sensitive to accusations of corruption. A second factor limiting  the size of bribes and corruption is simply competition. You could imagine, for instance, that there are numerous legislators willing to sell their vote to interest groups, and there's a kind of bidding process which goes on.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-J-l766GEk
Tullock Paradox,"If a government decision  were simply up to one person, that person could  demand a very high price. But, let's say that a lobby  requires five extra votes and there are a hundred  legislators willing to sell their vote. Well, there will be a process  of supply and demand but the more politicians, or the more political coalition's, or the more regulators,  or judges, or whatever, are willing to sell their vote  or sell their support, the price for that support  will be correspondingly lower. Let's go back to that agricultural subsidy worth, say, 10 million. If a political coalition were to demand,  say, $9 million to hand out that subsidy, that coalition might be replaced by another willing to do the same for $8 million and then competition will bring  that price successively down.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-J-l766GEk
Tullock Paradox,"Finally interest groups may  be unwilling to pay larger bribes simply because they do not always trust government. So, again, say there's an agricultural subsidy of $10 million and farmers are charged  by politicians $9 million to put that subsidy in place, there's the risk that once  the $9 million is paid the government then  turns around a day later and removes the subsidy  and tries to sell it again, either to that group of farmers or  to some other set of interest groups. So, there's a general lack of trust when it comes to corruption and, of course, it's not hard to understand why, you would not trust the corrupt people you're dealing with. But the very existence of that lack of trust means that the price for bribes and corrupt transactions may be correspondingly lower. For further information and analysis on this topic, you can google Tullock paradox.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-J-l766GEk

Causes of Corruption,"So, what do we know about what causes corruption? One of the best pieces on this topic is by Daniel Treisman. Let's look at its results a little more closely. He rates countries on the basis  of how corrupt they are, using three different indices of  corruption from a group called Transparency International. Most researchers regard these indices as actually pretty accurate.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ek7vnbi0KX0
Causes of Corruption,"He then looks to see which features of a country are positively correlated with the country having  a high rating for corruption. We'll look at the different hypotheses in this paper noting, of course, that hypothesis doesn't mean it's true; it's simply something we're going to investigate. For instance, how much does having a common law system matter? Actually, it turns out this result is unclear. If a country is a colony of British origin, it turns out that having a common law system is correlated with lower corruption.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ek7vnbi0KX0
Causes of Corruption,"But if the country was not  previously a British colony, having, a common law system is correlated with higher corruption. So, on that, the effect of having a common law system is quite unclear. One of the most significant variables  for explaining low levels of corruption, is having had the heritage  of being a British colony. This holds up even if we adjust  for greater openness to trade, or democracy, or religious tradition. It seems that the former British colonies, somehow, had instilled in them greater protections against official abuse.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ek7vnbi0KX0
Causes of Corruption,"There are two striking things about this correlation. First, in the former British colony, people are especially likely to have  confidence in the quality of judges more than they have confidence in the quality of politicians. Second is that, from a poll of businessmen, they're more likely to have confidence that the legal system will be enforced fairly. So, if we try to think about which features of having been a British colony are the ones that are important; maybe it's not about electoral politics but it's somehow the quality  of the judiciary and its fairness. Countries with a protestant religious tradition also are less corrupt on average.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ek7vnbi0KX0
Causes of Corruption,Why might this be? We really don't know. One interpretation is that Protestantism may allow for a greater tolerance for challenges to authority. The second possibility is the stress of Protestantism on casting out the wicked. Some say that Protestantism allows for greater focus on the individual rather than the family and  this leads to less corruption.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ek7vnbi0KX0
Causes of Corruption,"Finally, it's been suggested that  Protestant societies tend to have greater separation  of church and state, and that may be another factor. But the data don't themselves  allow us to judge on these issues. Democratic countries also  tend to be less corrupt, but there's something very interesting in the data here. Simply having democracy now  doesn't make the country less corrupt. The democracies which are less corrupt are those which have had uninterrupted democracy  for 40 years or more.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ek7vnbi0KX0
Causes of Corruption,"So, actually, it's the distant past which matters, it's the traditions which are fostered by having long periods of democratic rule. You cannot create all the benefits  of a democracy overnight. The wealthier and more literate  countries are also less corrupt and this is indeed a very strong effect. For instance, Treisman,  in the paper, notes that a tenfold increase in  the 1990 per-capita GDP; to go from, say, that of  El Salvador to that of Canada; would lead to a drop in the corruption rating of between 4.16 and 4.76 points. That would bring El Salvador up to somewhere about to the level of Hong Kong or Ireland in terms of having a low level of corruption.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ek7vnbi0KX0
Causes of Corruption,"Wealth here really matters. Is it the case that corruption is low  when public salaries are relatively high, as has proved to be the case in Singapore? Well, in this data set,  it turns out we simply can't tell. We'll be returning to this question later in another unit. What about political instability?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ek7vnbi0KX0
Causes of Corruption,"Well, that actually doesn't turn up as being significant in any of these statistical regressions. So, on that, in this paper, Treisman remains agnostic. What about government  intervention in the economy? Does that cause more corruption? Well, on this again, the author isn't sure.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ek7vnbi0KX0
Causes of Corruption,"He found that in his 1996 data, there was a connection between government intervention and corruption, but, when he looked at  the 1997 and 1998 data sets, it turned out there wasn't a connection. So, on this, as with political instability, he remains agnostic. What about openness to trade? Well, when exposure to imports is high, corruption is somewhat lower, but this is actually quite  a small effect quantitatively. How about lots of natural resources?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ek7vnbi0KX0
Causes of Corruption,"Do they tend to make a country more corrupt. This is, again, a case  where it's hard to say. When we look at data from the 1980s, it appears there is a relationship. But when we look at data from the 1990s, it appears that relationship has gone away. This is, yet, another case where  some agnosticism is an order.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ek7vnbi0KX0
Causes of Corruption,"How about ethnic division or what is, sometimes, called ethno-linguistic fragmentation? Well, it turns out that this doesn't seem to predict corruption. Once we adjust for  the wealth of an economy, it turns out that ethnic division doesn't matter for explaining corruption. Corruption is correlated with  having a federal structure much as the United States does. Why might this be?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ek7vnbi0KX0
Causes of Corruption,"We're not sure, but it could be  that in a very decentralized society there are all different levels of officials who can get in your way or stop something, and maybe that makes it more likely that you'll need to bribe one of them. So, overall, what are the most robust variables for predicting corruption? They turn out to be British heritage,  Protestant tradition, economic growth, having a federal structure, uninterrupted  democracy for 40 years or more, and openness to imports. These variables, together, actually  can account for more than 89 % of the variation in the Transparency  International indices of corruption. That's actually a somewhat  impressive result.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ek7vnbi0KX0
Causes of Corruption,"You might also wonder, which of the countries which are more corrupt or less corrupt than the model predicts? Well, if we look at the 1980s, the countries which turn out to be more corrupt than their underlying  variables would predict; those are Thailand, Mexico,  Egypt, Indonesia, Haiti, and Zaire. In the 1990s, the list changes. It's Italy, Belgium and, sorry to say,  my country, the United States. Interestingly, over this period of time, Africa, on the whole, is less corrupt  than the model predicts.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ek7vnbi0KX0
Causes of Corruption,"Given its relatively low level  of per capita income, we would expect Africa to be  more corrupt than it really is. What can we say about  what's cause and what is effect? For instance, if wealthier  nations are less corrupt, is it the case that because they are wealthy they are less corrupt? Or is it the case that because they are less corrupt they are wealthy? Arguably, both effects are operating.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ek7vnbi0KX0
Causes of Corruption,"This is a tricky problem in  many statistical investigations. Treisman attempts to overcome it  by focusing a lot of his attention on very long-term variables which are not changing in the short run with corruption. For instance, if you think about our list of the variables which really mattered: 40 years or more of democracy, a British colonial heritage,  and Protestant religious tradition; there's really not a plausible way to say that low corruption brought about the protestant religious tradition from the distant past. It's far more likely to be the case that the Protestant religious  tradition is the active variable, in some manner, driving  the lower level of corruption. This paper leaves a lot of open questions and questions unanswered or hanging or, maybe, areas where we're agnostic.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ek7vnbi0KX0
Causes of Corruption,"But, still, it's considered to be one of the most important studies of the causes of corruption.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ek7vnbi0KX0
Corruption and Output Composition,"One of the problems with corruption is that sometimes you get the wrong outputs, the wrong kinds of output. Let's compare two kinds  of government projects. The first kind of project is local, small-scale, labor-intensive; imagine educating children in a village. The second kind of project is really glamorous, it's capital-intensive. It has a lot of hard to value  outputs and inputs.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5PlgkSfDK4
Corruption and Output Composition,"Imagine, for instance, government building a large dam. With which kind of project is it easier to skim money off the top? Well, when the inputs of the project are opaque, when the project lacks transparency and when there are large expenditures running both in and out the project. In that case, it's probably easier to have bribery and corruption. So what is the result of this?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5PlgkSfDK4
Corruption and Output Composition,"A lot of governments will build too many large-scale capital projects with high value of inputs and outputs and perhaps too few small-scale, local labor-intensive outputs such as educating children in a village. And again, this is a distortion driven by corruption. This argument came from a paper called ""Corruption"" by Shleifer and Vishny.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5PlgkSfDK4

But the concept also has been extended to other nations. I clicked on one of those bribe reports and here's what I read. There is a gentleman who wanted  to buy a trade license and the government official started off  the conversation by saying, and I quote: ""Sir, I am corrupt, I am like a mosquito, who will suck your blood only once and will not trouble you again, I will give you four options..."" Basically, it boiled down to: He could pay the bribe and  get a license in ten days, or not pay the bribe and maybe  get a license in about six months. The officer then explained that  he himself needed the money because he had to pay a bribe to get his daughter into the right school.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSm4DZL0dgc

Indian Drivers,"Very often, the social cost from corruption isn't really well captured by the notion of people having to pay bribes. The true and proper social costs have to do with lower quality social outcomes. We're going to look at the country of India and the topic of corruption in the issuing of driver's licenses. I'll be drawing on a very good paper on corruption and it is entitled ""Obtaining a Driver's License in India"". The author set out to answer a pretty simple question: Should this guy be on the road or not?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvLGP6Ggw28
Indian Drivers,"It turns out the answer is going to be a little scary and thats because of corruption. The author set up an experiment to try to figure out how corrupt was the process of issuing drivers licenses in India. There are three different groups involved. First, they took a randomly selected group and offered them a bonus if those individuals could get a license, especially fast. The quickest you could get a license in this context was within 32 days.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvLGP6Ggw28
Indian Drivers,"There is a second group, also randomly selected and that group was taken aside and given driving lessons There was a third group and that group was left alone as they just navigated the process of getting a driver's license in India. At the end of all of this investigation,  what the authors are going to do is compare the three groups and see what we can learn from that comparison. The important point here is that  one group has a special incentive to navigate the process especially quickly, that's the first group. The people in that first group; they generally hire a bunch of individuals who are called agents. These agents help you navigate the driver's license process in India.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvLGP6Ggw28
Indian Drivers,"The agents, in effect,  they bribe the process for you. You don't have to engage in the corruption yourself. You hire the agent to help you. The agent knows the ins and outs of the bureaucracy. Basically, the agent issues some bribes to make sure you can get a license and you can get a license quickly.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvLGP6Ggw28
Indian Drivers,"That's whats going on with the first group. So, what are the results? This first group of individuals, who are paid the bonus if they got licenses quickly; they did in fact get the licenses quickly due to the aid of the agents and they got the licenses at a higher rate. 71% of the group paid the bonus, got the licenses, whereas in the control group, only 48% of them managed to get the licenses. In other words, some of the individuals were paying to get the licenses, when really maybe they should not have had the licenses at all.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvLGP6Ggw28
Indian Drivers,"You can think of this picture as one instance of the social costs of corruption Just how big is this problem? Well, it turns out it's a somewhat grim story. Of the bonus group, only 38% had to actually take and pass a driving test to get a license That's because of the aid  of these corrupt agents. Those who were in the bonus group who got a license, they were then independently tested to see whether or not they were good drivers. It turns out that 65% of them failed that test.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvLGP6Ggw28
Indian Drivers,"Maybe those individuals should not be on the road. This is, again, another lesson in the high social costs of corruption.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvLGP6Ggw28
Jagdish N. Bhagwati,"Jagdish Bhagwati was born in 1934 to a Gujarati family in Mumbai. He spent a lot of his career teaching  at MIT and Columbia University. Bhagwati wrote a famous paper  on what he called directly unproductive,  profit-seeking activities or DUP. This is sometimes called rent-seeking behavior by other economists. The point here is simple.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2IeHaXgFXI
Jagdish N. Bhagwati,"Often, individuals invest their resources in trying to take or extract  wealth from others usually through politics rather  than producing or innovating. When this happens, it leads to lower rates of productivity growth in an economy. Bhagwati, along with  Gordon Tullock and Anne Krueger, was one of the first economists  to point out the importance of directly unproductive, profit-seeking activities or again, as it is often called, rent-seeking. For decades, Bhagwati has been a major advocate of free trade and globalization. And, in many ways, he has defended a classically liberal point of view on development economics.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2IeHaXgFXI
Jagdish N. Bhagwati,"Bhagwati has a keen appreciation  of the virtues of markets and he also understands that,  in an open trading economy, the incentives are stronger for  a production and innovation and the incentives are weaker for his directly unproductive, profit-seeking DUP activities. Bhagwati, however, has not been an advocate for free markets in all regards. In the late 1990s, he wrote some pieces arguing that free capital movements were not as good for developing economies as where the free movement of goods. When goods cross borders, what happens is that each economy becomes more productive and living standards go up. Bhagwati worried that  when capital crossed borders, there was the risk that capital would  first flow into a developing economy and then later be pulled out very rapidly leading to a lot of unneeded volatility  and also perhaps some financial crises.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2IeHaXgFXI
Jagdish N. Bhagwati,"This argument was seen as very important during the Asian financial crises of the late 1990s, at the time Bhagwati wrote. In some, Bhagwati is one of  the most important and most influential Indian  development economists. He has made major contributions to the key areas of corruption, trade, and the flow  of international capital.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2IeHaXgFXI
How to Fight Corruption,"There is a separate video unit on raising the wages and salaries of public officials. But what other ideas might there be for fighting corruption? Robert Klitgaard is a leading expert in this area and you can find some of his writings on fighting corruption online. This isn't an area where there's  a lot of fancy theory or statistical results  that are easily generalizable. But, nonetheless, there are a lot of procedures that have worked, even though not every procedure is going to work in every country.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5YKuArCe_g
How to Fight Corruption,"One option is simply to reduce  the size of government. If government is handing out  fewer resources and privileges, there may be less to be corrupt about. More transparency  is often a good option, so that citizens and observers  can see what's going on. Klitgaard writes about the option  of setting up an anti-corruption bureau or an ombudsman  whose sole job it would be to identify and publicize corruption. Clear performance standards for public sector employees are very often a good idea, and there can be special  anti-corruption courts which make sure that corruption  cases get a fairly speedy trial.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5YKuArCe_g
How to Fight Corruption,"Auditing and accounting  can be highly useful for tracing the flows of money and making sure that spending  is going where it ought to be going. What else? Well, another approach  is to use publicity and, perhaps, some  highly visible court cases to break down this general  sense of immunity so that bureaucrats,  and public sector officials, and businessmen start thinking  they can actually get in trouble for being corrupt. Running diagnostics and figuring out where corruption is worse is another option. Simply increasing the penalties  for corruption, sometimes, can work.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5YKuArCe_g
How to Fight Corruption,"Taking greater care to recruit public sector employees by merit. And finally, identifying which are the favorable forces in a society opposed to corruption and having the government anti-corruption campaign align itself with those forces. Again, this section doesn't have a whole lot of fancy or generalizable theory. But if you're curious, what are some of the things that have been done to limit corruption? Well, those are the beginnings of a list.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5YKuArCe_g
How to Fight Corruption,"Here's the good news. Corruption really can be limited. It really is the case that,  most of the world was much more corrupt a century ago or 50 years ago than it is today. When it comes to corruption,  there really is hope.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5YKuArCe_g
Corruption and Public Sector Wages,"One of the most common suggestions for fighting corruption is to raise public sector wages. Let's look at this idea  a little more closely. Pretty much everyone is against corruption but the tough question is: How to move from a corrupt  society to a non-corrupt society? Singapore, in fact, has done that. After World War 2, Singapore had  a reputation as being quite a corrupt place.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF_w_v7FDXI
Corruption and Public Sector Wages,"Today, and indeed for decades, Singapore has had  the reputation of being one of the least corrupt  countries in the world. Part of their recipe was  to raise public sector wages and have very tough monitoring  and punishment programs for public sector officials  who were corrupt. South Korea has done something similar. But can this recipe  be applied more generally? There's an interesting paper called ""Corruption and the Rate of Temptation"".",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF_w_v7FDXI
Corruption and Public Sector Wages,"It was originally written for the IMF but it was then published in the Journal of Development Economics. Let's see what that paper has to say. This paper starts with the idea of  what is called an efficiency wage, an idea which has been  developed by Joseph Stiglitz. The notion of an efficiency  wage is fairly simple. It means that if you don't  pay people very much, they'll do the wrong thing, they'll shirk, they'll take bribes, whatever, because they're not really  afraid of being fired.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF_w_v7FDXI
Corruption and Public Sector Wages,"If they're fired, they can  go and get another job that pays them more or less  the same, maybe even more. But if you pay people really quite a bit, that's called the efficiency wage, they will be more likely to obey you, less likely to shirk,  and less likely to be corrupt. So, perhaps one of the solutions  to public sector corruption is to pay public sector officials  an efficiency wage and then tell them not to be corrupt. The results of this paper indicate that an efficiency wage approach may indeed work. For instance, an increase in the ratio  of civil service to manufacturing pay is associated with an improvement  in the corruption index.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF_w_v7FDXI
Corruption and Public Sector Wages,"This doesn't prove that the change in pay is what made the corruption index better, but it is indicative that there  may be some kind of relationship. That said, it's not actually that easy to eradicate corruption altogether or nearly so. This would require a civil service wage nearly three to seven times higher than the manufacturing wage. That's actually unrealistic. There are only a few countries in the world which have a ratio of civil service wages to manufacturing wages of about two to three, much less three to seven.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF_w_v7FDXI
Corruption and Public Sector Wages,"So, this implies that, while higher  wages may help eliminate corruption, it's really very hard for that  to be your only tactic. A government may not be able  to afford those higher wages or the public may judge those higher wages for the bureaucrats as being unfair. The authors also cautioned  that increases in wages do not have an immediate  effect on corruption. That is, it's only when that wage  increase has been established for some period of time  that it seems to be effective. Finally, the authors indicate that  civil service wages are highly correlated with measures of the rule of law  and the quality of bureaucracy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF_w_v7FDXI
Corruption and Public Sector Wages,"This evidence should not be taken as final, but it really does seem to indicate there's something to  the efficiency wage approach when it's combined with monitoring  and punishment for wrongdoing. That is there are possible  ways out of the corruption trap.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF_w_v7FDXI
Does Foreign Aid Increase Growth?,Today we are going to be looking at a controversial question. Foreign Aid: Does it Increase Growth? I think the first thing which needs to be acknowledged is that we were much more optimistic about the role of foreign aid and growth inside the 1960s. Here's Paul Rosenstein-Rodan. You can find out more about him by the way in another video lecture in this series.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HphxjhAz5Kw
Does Foreign Aid Increase Growth?,"He said: ""Launching a country into self-sustaining growth is a little like getting an airplane off the ground. There's a critical ground speed which must be passed before the craft can become airborne"". So he was talking about the theory of the Big Push. The idea that, if we increase  investment, let's say, enough, that a country would begin to launch itself on the path of development. That once we pushed, once that country reached ground speed, reached that critical speed, however, it would take off on its own.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HphxjhAz5Kw
Does Foreign Aid Increase Growth?,"It would begin to fly. So the question is: When we gave foreign aid, did the countries begin to fly? On the whole, the answer is no. Some countries, it is true, did take off but they were the ones who didn't receive a lot of foreign aid. The countries that received a lot of foreign aid simply did not take off.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HphxjhAz5Kw
Does Foreign Aid Increase Growth?,"This, by the way, is a picture of the Spruce Goose. Howard Hughes' famous plane. The world's largest plane at the time it was built. It had one flight. This was as far off the ground as it ever got and it never flew again.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HphxjhAz5Kw
Does Foreign Aid Increase Growth?,"So what happened? We could talk about corruption. We could talk about the importance of institutions, incentives, and so forth. We do a lot of that in other video lectures. So I want to give a slightly different  perspective in this lecture.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HphxjhAz5Kw
Does Foreign Aid Increase Growth?,"And I want to compare the predictions of the Big Push with the predictions of the Solow model. If you didn't do the Solow model in previous video lectures, don't worry, you'll get the basic idea here. If you did do the Solow model, you remember that the sort of natural raid  of the capital stock is given when the investment is equal to depreciation. And that natural level of capital, that also will give you a natural level of GDP per capita. Your GDP per capita, your steady-state GDP per capita, which is given by your investment and your depreciation, population growth but also by the fundamental institutions of your society, the productivity organization and so forth.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HphxjhAz5Kw
Does Foreign Aid Increase Growth?,"In the Big Push model, foreign aid pushes you to the tipping point -- to change the metaphor a little bit -- and gets you on that self-sustaining path of growth. What happens with foreign aid in the Solow model? In the Solow model, some foreign aid will increase your capital stock. You build some bridges, some railroads, some roads, some factories and so forth. That's great, that increase capital stock will get you increased GDP per capita.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HphxjhAz5Kw
Does Foreign Aid Increase Growth?,"However, if you haven't changed any of the fundamentals in the economy, If all you have done is increase the capital stock Then what happens is your depreciation will exceed your investment In other words, the Solow model predicts that without changing any of the fundamental factors and increase in the capital stock above its steady-state level, it will begin to depreciate. The roads will begin to fall apart and they won't be repaired. The factories will begin to break down and there won't be enough savings to fix the factories. The bridges will start to fall apart and so forth. And, in fact, in many cases, this is exactly what happened.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HphxjhAz5Kw
Does Foreign Aid Increase Growth?,"Factories were built in Ghana and they began to fall apart and no one replaced them. Roads started to crumble. Even the infrastructure; which was considerable leftover from the colonial period; started to decline. Because of this, countries were pushed back towards their steady-state level of capital, their steady-state level of GDP. So, from the Solow model, we have that if you don't improve any of the fundamental factors; organization, technology, investment and so forth; that an increase in foreign aid is just going to create depreciation, it's going to put you back to your steady state.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HphxjhAz5Kw
Does Foreign Aid Increase Growth?,"That's the basic story. I want to talk a little bit about some of the recent econometrics literature on aid and growth. The modern literature  began with Boone who, using data from 96 countries over a period of about 20 years, found that aid didn't increase investment. That is that you couldn't even find growth, you couldn't even find a connection between aid and the things which caused growth, such as investment. This led to a lot of debate, a lot of different papers coming forth, back and forth, yes and no.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HphxjhAz5Kw
Does Foreign Aid Increase Growth?,"The debate seemed to be resolved by the Burnside and Dollar paper. This paper sort of split the difference in a way. It said, ""Overall, aid does not work. But when aid is combined or interacted with good policy, it does work"". So, when a country begins to get its act together, when it has opened its borders, when it reduces corruption, Burnside and Dollar said, ""That is the time that aid works"".",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HphxjhAz5Kw
Does Foreign Aid Increase Growth?,"This really made both sides of people, both sides of the debate happy and it seemed to suggest a policy direction that we ought to tie aid to making policy better. However, Easterly, Levine and Roodman found that the Burnside and Dollar result was not robust. And I want to say a little bit more about that. So here's the basic story. What this graph shows -- Let's start with the one on the left.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HphxjhAz5Kw
Does Foreign Aid Increase Growth?,"-- is once you have control for all the other factors, what is the effect of aid interacted with policy? In the original Burnside and Dollar paper, you had basically this story right here. You had a positive effect of aid after you have control for other factors and when that aid was interacted with good policy, okay? Even in the original Burnside and Dollar result, you can see that it's not a terribly strong result. It may be driven by some outliers possibly.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HphxjhAz5Kw
Does Foreign Aid Increase Growth?,"A lot of other things are explaining growth rather than aid. The effect is not that large and so forth. Even taking into account that it wasn't a strong result to begin with, Easterly, Levine and Roodman ran it with a little bit longer data, and over here you see the same basic regression, same variables and now you have actually a negative result but it's not statistically significant. So the whole result goes away with just minor changes and assumptions. The most recent paper in this literature is by Clemens and co-authors.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HphxjhAz5Kw
Does Foreign Aid Increase Growth?,"It's a very good paper. What they do is they basically re-run all of their regressions which had been run before, and, by creating a consistent data set of control variables, they try and pinpoint where the agreements are, where the disagreements are, what are generating some of the differences. They also point out many of the reasons why it may be difficult to find an effect of aid on growth. So, for example, consider timing. When would you expect aid to have an effect on growth?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HphxjhAz5Kw
Does Foreign Aid Increase Growth?,"If you spend aid this period, will it cause the economy to grow right away? In a year, in two years, in five years? Depending upon exactly what you're spending on, if you're building a road or a bridge, for example, it may take several years to even build the bridge or the road, and then you might not expect growth for several years down the line after that. That's one reason why it's difficult. Another reason, which a lot of the literature has tried to deal with, is, ""what about if you give aid to the countries which really most need it, while those are the countries which are growing slowest""?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HphxjhAz5Kw
Does Foreign Aid Increase Growth?,"So you might get a correlation between aid and slow growth even when aid in fact does increase growth. There's been a lot of different attempts to try and overcome this reverse causality problem. So, when Clemens and co-authors deal with these things as best as they can what they do is they argue that  there are modest effects of aid on growth. And just to illustrate how modest these are, I want to give you some quotes from their article. And it's really quite illustrative when you compare with some of the more optimistic predictions from the 1960s.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HphxjhAz5Kw
Does Foreign Aid Increase Growth?,"So, what they say, for example, is: ""It is clear that in many countries, even large aid inflows have been insufficient to spark growth over any time horizon"". So, if you're in a poverty trap, it's really, really hard to get out even with a lot of aid sometimes. ""Aid appears to have a non-linear effect on growth, and there may be limits on the degree to which even large aid receipts can further increase growth in the typical recipient"". So, a little bit of aid may go a long way, but, as you acquire more and more aid, you get less of a growth effect. ""Far more of the variance in growth across countries is accounted for by the non-aid covariates, the non-aid variables for explanatory factors.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HphxjhAz5Kw
Does Foreign Aid Increase Growth?,"in these regressions than by the aid variable"". So, even when aid matters, it matters less than just about-- than many other things So, I think that's  an accurate consensus view of the literature on foreign aid and growth today.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HphxjhAz5Kw
Examples of Aid that Works,"Foreign aid has certainly not  been a failure in all respects. In this lecture, I just want to give a few examples of foreign aid that really has worked well. Perhaps, the most successful example  of foreign aid is the Green Revolution. This is both a scientific  and a political triumph. On the science side,  beginning with Norman Borlaug, working with the aid of the Rockefeller Foundation in Mexico to develop through cross fertilization, new superior agricultural varieties of plants which were much  more productive, higher yielding.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoBw9cf-EZQ
Examples of Aid that Works,"Higher yielding wheat,  higher yielding rice combined with the proper use of fertilizer and pesticides, these techniques meant  that a billion people, who quite likely would have died, were able to live. On the political side, these ideas were adopted with the help of the Ford Foundation, brought to India. With the help of people  like Chidambaram Subramanyam. Chidambaram Subramanyam was  India's Minister of Food and Agriculture. And acting as a political entrepreneur, he was able to overcome  opposition to these new ideas and very quickly have them  spread throughout India, saving hundreds and hundreds  of millions of people.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoBw9cf-EZQ
Examples of Aid that Works,"This is the Green Revolution. Ford Foundation, Rockefeller Foundation were extremely important in making it happen. An important point to keep in mind is that aid can reduce suffering,  and death and dying, even without increasing growth. Aid can help people  without increasing growth. Some simple examples: Oral rehydration therapy has saved  many children from dying of diarrhea.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoBw9cf-EZQ
Examples of Aid that Works,"Vaccines have saved many children. When you save a child  with oral rehydration therapy, mechanically, that reduces GDP per capita, but it makes the parents better off,  it makes the child better off, it doesn't make anyone else worse off. So, this is definitely a case  where aid can help. Another recent example is a spread  of bed nets to reduce malaria in Africa. So, in Kenya between 2003 and 2008, the fraction of households owning at least one insecticide-treated bed net increased from just 8.3 % to 61 %, almost 61 %, in just five years.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoBw9cf-EZQ
Examples of Aid that Works,"At the same time, Kenya's rate  of post neonatal deaths, deaths under age 5;  they dropped by more than half. Now other things were going on at the same time, including higher GDP per capita, better water supplies,  better healthy infrastructure. But it's been estimated that half  of the drop in postneonatal death was explained by the spread of bed nets alone. Now, it's interesting to point out that these characteristics of successful foreign aid efforts have a few things in common. So, think about oral rehydration  therapy, vaccines and bed nets.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoBw9cf-EZQ
Examples of Aid that Works,"One thing they have in common is they're all quite cheap. That means that, there's not a lot of point in stealing  oral rehydration therapy, it's not worth it. Not a lot a lot of ways  you could be corrupt there. And they also involve a lot of self-help. So, oral rehydration therapy was  really just going door-to-door, explaining to mothers how to create the combination of fluids - a little bit of salt, a little bit of sugar - and how to give it to their children,  and that alone saved millions of lives.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoBw9cf-EZQ
Examples of Aid that Works,"So, these cheap... readily available in poor countries; not a lot of investment required and self help. All of these things really were effective. Finally, it would be remiss of me not to mention the greatest anti-poverty program ever, which is immigration. Bringing immigrants from Haiti  to the United States for example is, by far, ... the most cost effective and... it's going to have the most effect on raising people out of poverty. Just bringing somebody  from Haiti to the United States; their income is probably going  to go up by at least 10 times.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoBw9cf-EZQ
Examples of Aid that Works,"Once they're here, many of them send back remittances  to their home country, to their family in their home country. Remittances, you know just like giving gifts even to your family, have problems, but overall remittances do appear to be more effective than straight foreign aid, perhaps because the givers do have better information about where the remittances can best be used, who can be trusted with them and so forth. Remittances are massive. In 2011, remittances were in the range of  almost 400 billion dollars worldwide, which significantly exceeds all foreign aid combined. So immigration and remittances; by far the best anti-poverty program ever.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoBw9cf-EZQ

The World Bank,"Let's now consider the role of the World Bank in the global economy. The World Bank was conceived of during World War II by Great Britain and the United States working together during a series  of meetings at Bretton Woods. From the beginning, the vision was  of a bank dedicated to the idea of economic development for  the poorer nations of the world. Some of the concrete goals stated by the bank itself are fighting poverty and hunger, educating, gender equality, health,  environmental sustainability, and, overall, all of those goals under a general rubric of economic development. Of those goals, two of them, gender equality and  environmental sustainability, are relatively recent.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqfVNIuR_kg
The World Bank,"There are several quite distinct institutions associated with the World Bank. The first is the International  Development Association or IDA as it is known for short. The IDA works with the very poorest nations, and offers zero interest loans, and, also, grants and aid. You can think of this as, very much, a kind of traditional aid agency. The International Bank for  Reconstruction and Development, also known as IBRD, is much more like a bank, as the name World Bank would suggest.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqfVNIuR_kg
The World Bank,"So, the IBRD borrows money from  private capital markets and then invests this money in projects in developing nations. The IBRD works with developing nations. But, unlike the IDA, it does not, in general, focus its activity on the very poorest of those nations. To get a sense of scope in a typical year, IDA expenditures might run  around 15 billion dollars. And the amount of money raised  in private capital markets by the IBRD might run in the range  of 10 to 15 billion dollars.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqfVNIuR_kg
The World Bank,"There is also the IFC or  the International Finance Corporation which is part of the broader World Bank Group, and this also serves banklike functions, trying to support private sector  investment in developing nations. If you're looking at the governance of the World Bank, you could start with the president of the World Bank. By convention, this person is  a citizen of the United States, and the United States has a very  significant role in choosing the person. The World Bank has executive directors coming from many nations. But the most fundamental form of governance in the World Bank are the voting rights  of particular nations.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqfVNIuR_kg
The World Bank,"And, here, the United States, the major European nations, and Japan  really have very significant influence over the World Bank through their ultimate voting rights. It has been a matter of real controversy whether developing nations should be given greater voting rights in the World Bank. Many poor individuals in developing nations have benefited a great deal from projects supported by the World Bank. But, let's look at a few of the major criticisms of the World Bank. One set of criticisms has been directed at the bank's programs for what is called 'structural adjustment.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqfVNIuR_kg
The World Bank,"' Under structural adjustment,  the bank lends money to a country, but it also asks that country  to make policy changes, typically, in the direction  of economic liberalization. This, of course, has proven very controversial. I'm not going to survey  these debates here, in this unit. But if you look at the other video units, as part of this course, you will find many particular details on whether various sectors should be seeing more economic liberalization or not. There's a second approach to understanding the World Bank and, probably, it's more of  an observation than a criticism, but the size of the World Bank has now become really quite small relative to the size of private capital markets to developing nations.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqfVNIuR_kg
The World Bank,"So, if we think of the IDA, in a typical year, as spending 15 billion dollars, and if we think of the IBRD  as being, in a typical year, in the range of 10 to 15 billion dollars, and there's the broader World Bank Group. But we're getting a total  impact in the range of several tens of billions of dollars. And, then, imagine that, in a typical year, private capital flows are, say, 600 billion dollars to developing nations, well, then the World Bank  looks quite small. These private capital flows are a good thing, and it was part of the original vision of the World Bank that private capital would step in and do a lot of what the World Bank did at first. But, nonetheless, what you hear often is exaggerated rhetoric about the World Bank, whether for good or for evil.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqfVNIuR_kg
The World Bank,"And the notion that the World Bank is somehow pulling the strings on the global economy, and  manipulating capital markets, and keeping poor countries under its boot or whatever is alleged  about the World Bank. Typically those claims  are serious exaggerations. The World Bank is one player  in economic development, but, in relative terms,  it's becoming smaller and, indeed, much smaller with the passage of time. Another criticism of the World Bank is that it's too much under the control of its own boards of directors. For instance, those boards tend to represent the United States and the wealthier European nations and Japan.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqfVNIuR_kg
The World Bank,"And, in part, they view the World Bank as a useful way of generating construction and infrastructure  contracts for corporations back in their home countries. And what they're interested in seeing the World Bank do is lend a lot of money and  give a lot of aid but in a form that will  involve these contracts for their own corporations. That's where a lot of the political support for the World Bank comes from. But, sometimes, this leads to harmful incentives because the incentives  within the World Bank are to get contracts out of the door. And, of course, the developing nations working with the World Bank; they know this.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqfVNIuR_kg
The World Bank,"So, sometimes, they're able  to manipulate the World Bank and get a contract when, ideally, perhaps the World Bank should take more time or impose greater conditionality or maybe cut off aid or cut off the loan. But, in fact, the incentive is, sometimes, to keep that stream of contracts running. And the overall result of  this equilibrium game between the developing nation,  the World Bank, and the individuals on the World Bank boards of directors who want a lot of construction contracts; often, from that mix, you end up  with a fair amount of inefficiency and not necessarily the most effective projects for a development aid. Of course, there's an enormous amount written on the World Bank. For a very simple start, use Google, but, also, consider googling the news.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqfVNIuR_kg
The World Bank,"So, go to news. google.com  and enter ""World Bank"" or enter ""World Bank"" and  the names of particular nations. And that's one way to start, getting a handle on what the World Bank is up to right now. I also recommend digging  into specific project areas, whether it be health, or education, or water policy, whatever. And you can do that by looking  at the other video units and following their suggestions  for further research.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqfVNIuR_kg
The World Bank,That's one very good way  to get a handle on these specifics of what the World Bank has been up to.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqfVNIuR_kg
The IMF,"Let's look at the International Monetary Fund or, as it's often called  for short, the IMF. The IMF was planned by the United States and Great Britain during World War Two and it started immediately  in the post-war era. The original goal of the IMF was something quite different from what it does today. Under the so-called Bretton Woods system of the post-war economic order, the major economic powers in the world were tied together by fixed exchange rates, and the role of the IMF was to oversee and administer those fixed exchange rates, and make sure that countries were able to keep their commitments. The Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate system ended in the 1970s and, over time, the roles of the IMF have evolved.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmf4ED0eCqc
The IMF,"The IMF still assists financially troubled nations, but, very often, it has nothing to do with the country having a fixed or floating exchange rate. The IMF has the power to lend money to nations in order to improve their financial prospects. One thing the IMF does is simply to oversee and study the global economy, and issue proclamations about what is going wrong, what is going right, and what could be done better. The IMF has a fair amount of  influence in this regard. The most significant and also  the most controversial role of the IMF has to do with its programs of conditional assistance.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmf4ED0eCqc
The IMF,"When the IMF lends money to countries, it typically insists that those countries  change their economic policies in some very particular ways. The IMF does not require  collateral for its loans, but it does require a new and different approach to economic policy. The conditional assistance typically  requires some kind of move toward a balanced budget or a sounder fiscal position, and it also requires some kind of liberalization of the underlying economy. When it comes to the underlying fiscal position, typically, the IMF will require  that countries do something to cut government spending  and also, perhaps, that countries in some way raise taxes. When it comes to liberalizing the economy, the IMF may typically require greater  openness toward foreign investment, freer trade, less regulation of business, and lower levels of corruption.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmf4ED0eCqc
The IMF,"Of course, the countries receiving IMF money can only satisfy these demands  to varying degrees depending upon both their willingness and their own internal politics. But at some point, the IMF will say: If you don't institute something like these policies, we will stop lending you money. Two of the classic cases of IMF  conditional assistance are Argentina and Indonesia. Sub-Saharan African nations are very poor, but often they have less to do with the IMF because they tend to have lower levels of indebtedness. You can think about the governance  of the IMF at a few different levels.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmf4ED0eCqc
The IMF,"First, there is a managing director. By convention, that individual is typically chosen from a European Union nation. Second, there are 24 executive directors who serve a board-like role. But the most fundamental source of governance has to do with the individual country quotas. The country quotas are determined by a formula and they are the ultimate source of voting rights within the IMF.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmf4ED0eCqc
The IMF,"The formula has to do with how large an economy is of a country and how open that economy is. And, overall, the country quotas have allocated quite a bit of influence in the IMF to the United States, the European Union, and japan. For instance, the country quota of the United States; it's somewhat above 17 %. And the country quotas of  the European Union nations, taken together, are slightly below 40 %. So, if you take just the United States and the EU together, that's about 57 % right there.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmf4ED0eCqc
The IMF,"For purposes of contrast under the current system, the country quota for China is in the neighbourhood of 6%. This has proven controversial  and, as you can imagine, there are frequent calls to alter or, somehow, change the quota system, so that developing nations have more influence within the IMF. There are a few different ways conceptually to try to think about what it is the IMF is actually doing with conditional assistance and its other policies. One way to think about it is to consider cases where a lot of countries in the world simply have very bad policies. Of course, that's likely to be the case if these countries are getting in financial trouble and, maybe, they simply need a spur to institute better policies and, sometimes, the IMF does that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmf4ED0eCqc
The IMF,"Another possibility is that, often, a country's leaders, or a lot of people, or interest groups in a country know what should be done, but they can't quite make it happen politically. And when the IMF comes along  and demands those policies, it gives them a kind of cover where they can say, ""I'm sorry, it's not my fault. The IMF is making me do this"". Even though it's something they have wanted to do all along or knew was necessary. Critics will more likely charge that the IMF is forcing developing nations or nations in trouble to institute policies which are more in the interests of wealthy nations.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmf4ED0eCqc
The IMF,"So, the IMF, in this view, is forcing nations to internalize a lot of the costs of their own policy mistakes. So, for instance, a country might end up cutting its expenditures on education or on health care to make sure  it moves toward a balanced budget. And this does, in fact, make sure that the country's problems don't spill over into the broader global economy. But it may not actually be better for a lot of the individuals living in that country. In this view, the IMF is a kind of tool  of a power-based global economic order and, sometimes, it does some good, but, a lot of times, it does some bad.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmf4ED0eCqc
The IMF,"And precisely because it's controlled by the wealthier nations, it tends to push her policies in the interests of the wealthier nations. In my personal view, there's some truth to all of these hypotheses. The roles and functions of the IMF are still evolving over time. If you pick a year like 2006, when the global economy  appeared to be doing very well, the IMF actually wasn't up to very much. Right now, as of 2012, the IMF has been quite active and it is taking on a growing role in Europe with the euro crisis.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmf4ED0eCqc
The IMF,"This is somewhat of a deviation from the IMF's traditional role which postulated a set of wealthier  nations who were backing the IMF and then a series of poorer nations who needed IMF aid. All of a sudden, it seems that a lot of the nations in the European Union may in fact be requiring IMF aid. We're in this funny situation where  the major backers of the IMF, the European nations, are in fact using it to bailout  their own project, namely, the eurozone. One way to read more about the IMF  is simply to google of course ""International Monetary Fund"". But often, one gets a better  sense of what's going on by reading about the IMF  in the news today.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmf4ED0eCqc
The IMF,"And to do that, go to news. google.com and in the search box enter ""International Monetary Fund"" and see what's going on right now.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmf4ED0eCqc
Finance and Growth,today we're going to talk about finance and development or growth let's begin with what finance does i see the financial system as having five major benefits one consumption smoothing second bridging the gap between savers and investors screening and monitoring of investments and diversifying and transformation and transforming risk and managing the payment system i'm going to say a little bit more about one two and three as we go along i'm not going to say very much about four and five in this lecture or even in this course let me just mention very briefly what i mean by diversification and transformation of risk a lot of what the financial system does is it takes short-term liabilities and turns those into long-term assets so for example it takes a demand deposit a deposit which the depositor can get back on demand and turns those into long-term loans the shadow banking system took overnight loans repo and turned those into valuable investments now we could say a lot more about what happens when this transformation of risk goes wrong what happens with leverage and so forth um but we'll save that for another time also managing the payment system like creating currency and checks and making it easier to buy and sell to transfer money one of the big things about that makes understanding the financial system important but also so difficult is that the payment system is tied so closely with these other aspects of the financial system so that when the transformation of risk for example goes wrong we have a collapse in the payment system at the same time and that causes all kinds of macroeconomic problems in any case those are problems for another day let's say a little bit more about one two and three most important for development one of the things the financial system helps people to do is to smooth their consumption over their lifetime so for example most people don't want to consume everything that they earn in their working years leaving them nothing for retirement or for the times when they can no longer work so they save up and the financial system helps them to save by channeling those savings into productive investments so the savers can be paid an interest rate similarly most people don't want to wait until they've accumulated enough assets to be able to buy a house or a car they'd like to consume the house early on and instead smooth out the payments over time so that's what a mortgage allows people to do it allows them to smooth their consumption have the house early on in life and pay for it over time the poor in the developing world also want a consumption smooth but for them in addition to consumption smoothing over their lifetime they often want a consumption smooth over a mere period of weeks or even of days so most people would prefer you know a few meals a day square meals a day rather than feast or famine so to avoid that successive feast or famine what the poor do is they make use of small savings accounts small means of saving sometimes literally under the mattress and so micro loans and so forth borrowing from a money lender we're going to be talking more about this in our discussion of microfinance getting beyond consumption smoothing a big part of what the financial system does is it takes the supply of savings and it moves that supply of savings to the demander the demanders for savings firms and entrepreneurs in particular so it takes people who are saving households perhaps they're saving up for retirement it takes those funds and through banks and the bond market and stock markets it delivers those funds to people who have ideas that's a a key aspect of uh specialization is that the people with the money are not always the people with the ideas the people with the ideas are not always for the people with the money so you want some institutions banks bond markets stock markets venture capitalists and so forth you want these institutions to be able to bridge the gap to take the supply of savings which is not doing anything useful which is sitting under the mattress and instead turn those savings into valuable investments with people who have ideas and this is all this is all about what the financial system does bridges of this gap part of bridging the gap is screening and also monitoring of investments so venture capitalists they don't just throw out their money willy-nilly they investigate the uh help the monitor the mentor people with whom they're going to invest the decide how the funds of society are going to be allocated to really new speculative risky ideas in this way these screen ideas banks do the same thing of course less risky ideas but banks screen new investments the screen borrowers they decide how the savings of their depositors are going to be allocated who has a good idea who doesn't have a good idea who is likely to pay the money back who is less likely to pay the money back so that's a lot of screening the bond in particular the stock markets also monitor investments you can see on a daily basis how different companies how different firms are doing this shows from google finance this is a graph of what has happened to apple stock and hewlett-packard stock over the past five years and you can see in 2007 they're basically the same but since 2007 even in as late as 2008 they're about the same but since that time apple stock has gone up by 600 percent so apple has clearly done something right on the other hand uh hewlett packard hewlett packard stock has fallen this is by about 50 percent so this tells investors that the management of apple is doing really well this is uh they are to be rewarded while hewlett packard is doing less well the managers perhaps we need a new group of managers in here so this is a way of monitoring investments and seeing what's going on in real in real time of course the key question here is does finance lead to growth does finance help development certainly if you take a first pass quick look at the data it seems that they're related if you look at the low income countries this is stock market capitalization as a fraction of gdp well if you look at low income countries you know stock markets are just not are their small share of gdp much smaller than in high income countries where where stock market capitalization can be almost as high on average this is on average as gdp so in the united states that would mean stock market capitalization on the order of 13 trillion dollars this is for all high-income countries almost one almost one-to-one with gdp much less for low-income countries we see very much the same pattern for private credit as a share of gdp so in low-income countries there's not a lot of borrowing or lending actually overall in high-income countries much much more so using this number as a number for the united states for example i don't know the exact numbers but using this as representative this means that in the united states there's about 13 trillion dollars of lending borrowing out there but the same as the amount of gdp quite a remarkable amount of borrowing and lending going on not so much over here now one might respond to this that this isn't causal i mean you could point out for example that there are more television sets in high income countries but this doesn't mean that cable tv creates growth rather it's the case that television sets are a response to high income not a cause of high income so perhaps private credit is a response to high income not a cause of high income so to show causality we want to investigate this in a little bit more depth we're going to look briefly at two papers which try and get at is the relationship between finance and growth or gdp per capita is it causal or is it just a correlation the first is by bob king and russ levine financing growth schumpeter might be right they look at 77 countries between 1960 and 1989.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfVMdvaH-w4
Why Microcredit?,"[Narrator] Microcredit refers to the short-term lending of small sums of money. Sometimes as little in value as $50 or $100. Furthermore, there is usually no  explicit collateral so a group of, say, five individuals or five families might  borrow from a microcredit institution. And each of the families is responsible for making sure that the other families repay the money. If one family cannot repay,  the other families are on the hook.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cngGhvFp4-M
Why Microcredit?,"Microcredit thus uses small groups  to monitor and enforce repayment. Sometimes, individuals just borrow once from a microcredit lender, repay the loan, and that's that. But it's quite common that families borrow from microcredit lenders on a recurring basis. They will take out some short-term loans for three or six months. And once they repay those loans,  they turn around and immediately borrow some more.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cngGhvFp4-M
Why Microcredit?,"There's a puzzle in microcredit and  that is, ""How can these poor families afford to pay the rates of interest they're paying to the lender""? It's not unusual for a microcredit loan  to have an annualized rate of interest of, say, %50 or %100. So if you're borrowing money at  an annualized rate of, say, %50, what is it you can do with the money that's so valuable that could possibly justify such a high rate of interest  on your repayment? Some people, of course, are bankrupted by their microcredit loans. But we also find many cases,  in fact, the majority of cases, where those microcredit loans are put to good use.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cngGhvFp4-M
Why Microcredit?,"Sometimes, microcredit loans are  used to start new businesses. And the new business may yield a  rate of return which justifies the payment of the interest. These new businesses don't have to  be large, multinational corporations. In fact, they pretty much never are. But imagine someone living in a village who wants to set up a shop to sell, say, cards for cellphones and that  individual needs some initial capital.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cngGhvFp4-M
Why Microcredit?,"Well, there's one rational for microcredit. Other individuals use microcredit  to finance their means of transport. Say you need to buy a scooter or a motorbike, maybe to help bring your child to school, or to get to your job on the other side of town, or to help run your business and buy some inputs or supplies and  bring them back to your shop. Well, for all of those purposes,  you might need transportation. And again there, you'll need some initial start-up capital.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cngGhvFp4-M
Why Microcredit?,"And the rate of return on getting  that transportation might be quite high. A lot of microcredit isn't invested  even though it may be -- sometimes, it's supposed to be. But it's used for purposes of consumption. And when I say consumption, I don't  usually mean buying fancy diamonds. It can be something as simple  and as essential as taking one's child to the doctor  when the child becomes sick.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cngGhvFp4-M
Why Microcredit?,"Again, there you'll see that having  some liquid assets on hand through the microcredit  can mean a very high rate of return. Especially in rural areas, sometimes  microcredit is invested in animals. A poor family in a rural area might prefer to have some animals around rather than to have a large,  or even moderate size stock of cash. When there's a lot of cash around, there's a tendency that relatives  or friends come and ask, basically, for their share of the cash because they need it for some urgent purpose. Social norms can make it difficult  to resist.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cngGhvFp4-M
Why Microcredit?,"Yet with animals, there's not necessarily the same problem. If you have a cow in your backyard  rather than some cash in your home, it's much harder for your friends  and acquaintances to come along and ask for their share of the cow. So microcredit can allow rural families to save resources in more efficient and more productive ways. Finally, the comparison isn't between microcredit and all of these families having  high net worth. It's simply not going to be the case.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cngGhvFp4-M
Why Microcredit?,"To a large extent, what has happened is that microcredit has replaced traditional village or urban moneylenders. And however high the rates of interest  may seem on microloans, well, they're actually usually lower than the  rates of interest from the moneylenders. The moneylender will charge more and  furthermore, if you don't pay back the moneylender, often  the moneylender is actually less gentle than has often been the case with microcredit institutions  which have a public reputation to maintain to a greater extent. In another unit, we'll now look at  the empirical evidence on just how much of microcredit  is useful and how much is not.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cngGhvFp4-M
Why Microsavings?,"Microsavings is a hot new idea  in development economics. It addresses a basic problem  faced by many poor people. Let's say you have a small amount  of money, say, equal in value to $150 and you want to set up a savings account. If you take this money to a large bank, they'll turn you away or maybe they'll even laugh at you. The cost of processing the papers,  setting up the account, and dealing with you means it's not worth while for them  to take care of your very small deposit.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QeyGL4CYVg
Why Microsavings?,"The results is that a lot of this money just sits around the homes of poor people and it's vulnerable to fire, it's vulnerable to theft. In fact, a lot of savings gets destroyed  by some kind of catastrophe or maybe it's taken by  someone visiting the home. And a lot of poor people, in fact,  would actually be willing to pay money to have some opportunity to save  their money in a secure place. The microsavings phenomenon is evolving through a few different routes. Nonprofits for instance are trying  to set up or encourage opportunities for very poor individuals to be able  to save very small sums of money.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QeyGL4CYVg
Why Microsavings?,"For instance, the Gate's Foundation  has been very active in this area. Another medium for microsavings has been actually the cell phone or technology. Using cell phones in  some parts of the world, it is possible to save  and store your money and transfer it to other people  while using electronic technology. Finally, banks in many countries  face burdens and regulations. To the extent these regulations can be moved, it will be cheaper  to supply banking services and banks will be more  interested in serving the poor.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QeyGL4CYVg
Why Microsavings?,"That too will make microsavings easier. Microsavings is, in general, considered  a very promising idea for the future. If you'd like to do  more reading in the area, here is one good paper on the topic.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QeyGL4CYVg
ROSCAs and Chit Funds,"Hi, today we're going to be looking  at ROSCAs and Chit Funds. What is a ROSCA, what is a Chit Fund? A ROSCA is a Rotating  Savings and Credit Association Here's how it works. We have four people,  Aadi, Hansa, Viraj and Prija. In period one, they each  put 10 dollars into a pot, creating a pot worth 40.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uehWKghoe4U
ROSCAs and Chit Funds,"One of them is then randomly  chosen to receive the entire pot. Let's suppose it's Hansa. In period two, each one again  puts ten dollars into the pot. The pot is again worth 40 dollars. Hansa, however, is no longer  eligible to receive the pot.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uehWKghoe4U
ROSCAs and Chit Funds,So there's a random choice  among the remaining three. Let's suppose Aadi wins the pot. In the third period  we have the same thing. Each one of them puts in 10 dollars. One of them is randomly  chosen to receive the pot.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uehWKghoe4U
ROSCAs and Chit Funds,"And then finally, in the fourth period, each one of them puts in 10 dollars and the one remaining person, in this case Prija, receives the pot. Okay, you might be asking what's the big deal? Aadi, Hansa, Viraj and Prija  each paid 40 dollars in total. Each received 40 dollars. What's the advantage?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uehWKghoe4U
ROSCAs and Chit Funds,"Well, the advantage here  is that with no ROSCA each person saves 10 dollars per period  and spends 40 in period four. With the ROSCA Hansa receives 40 dollars in period one, three periods earlier. Aadi receives 40 in  period two, two periods earlier. And Viraj receives 40 in  period three, one period earlier. Prija receives 40 in period four,  the same as before.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uehWKghoe4U
ROSCAs and Chit Funds,"So three of them are better off  in getting the money earlier. The fourth one is  at least as well off as before. In fact, in expectation, all of them are better off. So this is a Pareto optimal scheme,  to use the language of economics. At least some people are better  and no one is worse off.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uehWKghoe4U
ROSCAs and Chit Funds,"Okay, that's a ROSCA. This is called a random ROSCA. In a random ROSCA, the person  who wins the pot is chosen randomly. In an auction ROSCA, the partial pot  goes to the highest bidder. Let's show how bidding works.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uehWKghoe4U
ROSCAs and Chit Funds,"Bidders are going to bid how much  they are willing to pay for the pot. So suppose the pot is 40. Aadi bids 5, Hansa bids 9  and Viraj and Prija bid 0. In this case, Hansa wins the pot. She receives the 40 dollars minus  her 9-dollar bid, or 31 dollars in total.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uehWKghoe4U
ROSCAs and Chit Funds,"Hansa's 9-dollar bid is then split  equally among the other members, three dollars,  three dollars, three dollars. A nice thing about the auction ROSCA is that it allows those  who have more urgent needs to receive the funds earlier  than those with less urgent needs. So again, this is the Pareto optimal  improvement to a random ROSCA. Another interesting thing  about these Auction ROSCAs is that how much people bid, that implicitly is  setting up an interest rate. It's telling us how much  people are willing to pay to receive the money earlier.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uehWKghoe4U
ROSCAs and Chit Funds,"So it's an interest rate. And how much people are going to bid  is going to be dependent therefore on how good their borrowing opportunities  are elsewhere in the economy. What's the interest rate  among moneylenders or among microcredit organizations,  or family and friends, and so forth. This means that the bidding process is actually quite complicated because it depends upon  the situation elsewhere in the economy. Also, since some of the bids  are going to be returned, you know, it might be a little bit of an incentive to bid higher to get the other person to bid higher,  so that you get a little bit more.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uehWKghoe4U
ROSCAs and Chit Funds,"So, it's a quite complicated auction process. And comparing theory and practice,  it turns out people actually do quite well at solving these problems. ROSCAs are very common,  both in history and around the world, Africa, Latin America, Asia. And in several African countries, it's been estimated that 50 to 90 percent  of the population participates in a ROSCA. In India, the indigenous  term for ROSCA is Chit Funds.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uehWKghoe4U
ROSCAs and Chit Funds,"And in addition to informal Chit Funds,  there are actually thousands of regulated commercial chit funds  which advertise their services. In a commercial chit fund,  a foreman organizes the fund and guarantees the pot against  a fault in return for a commission. Often the foreman might get the first pot, for example. Organized chit funds are  more common in urban regions where people don't know  each other as well as in villages. And the foreman's job is to balance  membership between savers and borrowers and to make sure that no one defaults.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uehWKghoe4U
ROSCAs and Chit Funds,"And if someone does default,  to make up for the pot. Some of the regulations require  foremen to put up, in advance, at least one pot to have that in escrow. In addition, there's  a limitation in many states on how much people are allowed  in an auction ROSCA to bid for the pot. So in effect, this is an usury rate,  a limit on the interest rate. Some of these regulations  are probably a good idea.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uehWKghoe4U
ROSCAs and Chit Funds,"More recently, there's been more regulation and this has been pushing people, particularly the poor, into the informal chit fund area. There are at least 10 times  as many informal chit funds as there are regulated  commercial chit funds. Both tend to work reasonably well. Though the informal  chit funds are more risky, particularly if you don't know  the other people who are investing. So why do people invest in ROSCAs?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uehWKghoe4U
ROSCAs and Chit Funds,"Well, as the name indicates,  it's about savings and credit. First it's a way of  creating discipline to save, helping to overcome  a self-control problem, having, every month, to put  something in the pot helps you to save. This could also be  another control problem. That is having to put  something in the pot every month means that somebody else can't spend that money. Perhaps a wife wants to stop a husband  from drinking the money away, for example.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uehWKghoe4U
ROSCAs and Chit Funds,"Sometimes that does happen. These savings are then often  used to purchase lumpy goods, perhaps a small business investment, an investment in a consumer durable  like a washing machine, investment in a marriage or even in jewelry, especially in India that's  quite a common big item to purchase. The Auction ROSCAs are also used for emergency credit situations. Sometimes it's hard  to distinguish these two uses. So, in a survey, 72% of chit fund members said that they were  doing this for savings reasons.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uehWKghoe4U
ROSCAs and Chit Funds,"That was ex-ante, however. If you looked among bidders  in any given month, why they were bidding, 'emergency needs' was listed by 56%, followed by business investment at 30%. So it's a combination of savings, having that money also  available for an emergency use. We'll be talking more  about finance in future lectures. It's important to keep in mind that ROSCAs and chit funds are part and parcel  of a large set of ways of getting credit.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uehWKghoe4U
ROSCAs and Chit Funds,"Borrowing from family  and friends is another, from micro lenders, from moneylenders, even from banks. Microcredit's very important,  ROSCAs are very important for balancing particularly consumers and  consumer durables and purchases. Even more important  for a country, however, is raising lots of money  to invest in big business, to invest in factories  and things of that nature, economies of scope and scale. That's what we'll be talking more about in future lectures on finance. Thanks.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uehWKghoe4U
Microcredit Evidence,"The best evidence on microcredit comes from randomized control trial studies. In a randomized control trial, the researchers take two roughly comparable groups, and in this case, they allow  one of those groups additional access to microcredit and the other group not. After some period of time, the two groups are studied, and the differences and outcomes  are taken as some measure of the efficacy, or lack thereof,  of microcredit. Do see our separate video unit  on randomized control trials, but for now, let's look at the evidence on microcredit from these trials. So far, the evidence is mixed.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TlQv0MXLmc
Microcredit Evidence,"There's a well-known paper by Dean Karlan and Jonathan Zinman. It looks at over 1,600 individuals  in Manila, in the Philippines. There's an average loan of $225 in value, and they then study these individuals after 11 to 22 months. They do find that microcredit increased borrowing among the group members who had additional access to microcredit. However, the rate of business activity went down slightly, and, furthermore, the rate of  reported subjective well-being also went down, very slightly, but still, it did not go up.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TlQv0MXLmc
Microcredit Evidence,"On the plus side, it seemed that microcredit made individuals better able to cope with risk, it strengthened community ties,  and it boosted access to informal credit. That is, if you had the option of  borrowing from the microcredit lender, you would find it easier to get credit from your immediate friends and neighbors. Perhaps the most comprehensive  study of microcredit comes out of MIT, and this took place in Hyderabad, India. Half of 104 slums were randomly selected and given additional access  to microcredit. It was found that this  increased their borrowing.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TlQv0MXLmc
Microcredit Evidence,"It was also found that,  15 to 18 months later, these groups had spent more money on durable goods, including machinery. Most importantly, the number of new businesses increased by one-third relative to the group that did not have additional access to microcredit. Interestingly, the effects depended on the kind of household. Households which already had businesses or which were inclined  to start new businesses, they're the households which  spent more on durable goods. Households which had a low propensity to become business owners, they actually increase their spending on nondurables, including temptation goods,  such as alcohol and cigarettes.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TlQv0MXLmc
Microcredit Evidence,"Overall, the study found  no impact of the microcredit on measures of health, education, or women's decision making. Further studies are required, but the Banerjee and Duflo paper  closes with the following sentence: ""Microcredit therefore  may not be the miracle that is sometimes claimed on its behalf, but it does allow households  to borrow, invest, and create and expand businesses"".",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TlQv0MXLmc
Robert Townsend,"The work of Robert Townsend  has helped us better understand how it is that poorer people  in developing economies insure themselves and each other. Townsend has spent a lot of his career  at University of Chicago and MIT. Townsend's early work was in very  mathematical branches of economic theory, such as Principal-Agent Theory  and Monetary Theory. But over time, he's actually become  much more of what you might call a quantitative economic anthropologist. Starting in 1998, he went to Thailand and choosing 16 villages began to collect systematic data on the incomes and consumption patterns  of individual families in those villages.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQo9RtGGfV8
Robert Townsend,"This became a data set  of unprecedented quality. When you think of the recent trend  in development economics toward developing one's own data set and going out in the field and getting very specific information  about individuals, Townsend in this was really  a methodological pioneer. The work of Townsend is important  not only for its method but what we learned  from that method. So Townsend and his co-authors have taken these many years of data  from Thailand, and to some extent India, and asked questions about risk. How do individuals respond to risk?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQo9RtGGfV8
Robert Townsend,"What if there's a bad crop one year,  perhaps because of bad weather? What happens if some other catastrophe  or misfortune befalls a family? How do incomes respond? How do consumption patterns respond? These were the questions which  motivated his data-gathering efforts.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQo9RtGGfV8
Robert Townsend,"Townsend's work shows that even when  explicit insurance markets are absent, in the sense of you can't go out and  buy a policy from an insurance company, there are nonetheless many  forms of implicit insurance, which can involve gifts or favor trading  or loans or sharing of income or other kinds of mutual aid. In one of his papers, he found that gifts  from other households in the same village equal about nine percent  of average expenditure. That's quite a bit. If a negative shock hits an individual household in a village, that household tends  to receive aid and loans from other households in the same village. If a negative shock  hits an entire village, well that village as a whole  tends to receive aids and loans and other forms of indirect assistance  from the surrounding region.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQo9RtGGfV8
Robert Townsend,"These are again both  forms of risk sharing. Townsend came up with  some very clever empirical tests. For instance, imagine a world  where there is no implicit insurance, and then there is a common  negative shock hitting a village. What we would expect is that  the decline of income for that village will predict a decline  in consumption quite well, because the people in that village can't  draw on resources from anywhere else. But what Townsend finds  is that in a lot of instances what predicts consumption  in the individual village is not shocks to  the income of the village, but rather shocks to the income  of the immediate surrounding region.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQo9RtGGfV8
Robert Townsend,"So, for instance, if one village is doing  poorly but the region is doing better, there will be an inflow of resources,  loans, aid, favor-trading, whatever, and if you find that it's the income  of the surrounding region which is predicting village consumption, that means the broader region in some way is helping out the individual village through implicit insurance  when the village needs that aid. Townsend's work shows some other  very interesting results. For instance, individuals  tend to be more insured if they have kin living  in the same village. That is, there are more people  more willing and able to help them out. He finds also that entrepreneurs,  on average, are the individuals who bear the most risk and who are least likely  to receive insurance.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQo9RtGGfV8
Robert Townsend,"Perhaps they simply  have a taste for greater risk or they have more resources. And Townsend finds that  a low implicit insurance is very important in these poor villages, that in general, there is not  full insurance in these cases. So that when bad things happen at the level of an individual family  or individual village, there is real suffering. There is an inflow of aid or loans, but that inflow doesn't make up completely for the bad event by any means. So exposure to risk is mitigated, but at the same time  exposure to risk really does matter.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQo9RtGGfV8
Robert Townsend,"It's a striking result to find that  individuals in relatively poor villages actually might be safer than you think. But this isn't just  a general proclamation, because of his data gathering  and his extremely careful methods, Townsend has given us  a pretty careful glimpse into exactly how risk-sharing works  in some poorer parts of the world. To learn more about Townsend,  it's pretty simple and direct, go to scholar. google.com,  type in his name. Also, you can google  ""Robert Townsend economist"".",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQo9RtGGfV8
Robert Townsend,"He's not the only famous  Robert Townsend, so put in that word ""economist"". And also for his work on Thailand, just google ""The Townsend Thai Project"".",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQo9RtGGfV8
Conditional Cash Transfers,"Conditional cash transfers have been  a very successful anti-poverty program especially in Latin America. In Mexico, for instance, the government started a program in 1997 called Progresa later relabeled Oportunidades which quite simply means opportunities. The way it works is pretty simple. If the family sends a child to school, the family is paid some cash  if the child continues to go to school. If a family regularly sends a child  to healthcare clinics, the family is paid some cash  and possibly also some in-kind aid such as nutritional supplements.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTQUXY-BjzY
Conditional Cash Transfers,"The exact sums will vary  with circumstances but imagine payments for child ranging between say 5 to 20 dollars a month. If your household is otherwise earning only, say, a few dollars a day, that's quite a considerable amount. In theoretical terms, you can think of these programs  as being quite special in two ways. First, they target aid at the level of the individual household by using census data. And second, they are multisectoral, that is they address education,  health, and nutrition all at once.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTQUXY-BjzY
Conditional Cash Transfers,"The government tries to find out exactly who needs the aid and then to deliver it. This program is based on a lot of data at the individual family level. So, we do have a good sense of how well it's working and it seems it's working  quite well indeed. For instance, the program really has led to improved school enrollment, especially for girls. At the same time, the program  has limited child labour.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTQUXY-BjzY
Conditional Cash Transfers,"You might think it's a problem that families earn less because the children are working less, but the transfers from the program more than make up for that difference. One study found that 26% of  the cash transfer is invested by the families who receive it. After 18 months, due to those investments, agricultural income went up by almost 10%. That means the families have permanently higher standards of living due to these conditional cash transfers. Finally, the program has indeed  brought better health and nutrition for the recipient children.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTQUXY-BjzY
Conditional Cash Transfers,"The program can be thought of  as a revolution in social policy. One aspect of the program  that's not always remarked upon is simply how scientific an approach  Mexico has taken to public policy not only implementing the program but tracking the results and fine-tuning it and  improving it over time. Arguably, Mexico is, in this case, taking a more scientific approach to public policy than is often done in,  say, the United States. The idea of conditional cash transfers is one which is spreading around the world, especially  in Latin America including Chile, Colombia  and especially Brazil. Studies also indicate  it's done a good deal to lift people out of poverty in Brazil.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTQUXY-BjzY
Conditional Cash Transfers,"This is a very well studied topic,  as I mentioned, with excellent data and it's possible to test  for various controls, say, by comparing families  who receive the cash transfers with families who do not. For further reading, I would recommend that you google some of these terms.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTQUXY-BjzY
AmartyaSen #1 on Capabilities,"Amartya Sen is an Indian and Bengali economist born in 1933 and winner of a Nobel prize in economics. Sen is such an important figure in development that he's going to get several video units! When Sen was appointed to Harvard University, he received a professorship. Not only in the economics department, but also in the philosophy department. So we are going to start with Sen on philosophy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKKs1rqdlmo
AmartyaSen #1 on Capabilities,"Development economists or policy advisors often find themselves in the position of having to address, ""What really is a good outcome anyway""? The typical standard of economics is to identify a good outcome with greater wealth or higher GDP. But Sen made the point that a country can be wealthy but perhaps not everyone in that country is very happy, or maybe people don't live very long, or maybe they have lives that, are to some standard, impoverished or lacking. So Sen has been a consistent critic of using wealth or GDP as a metric for a good outcome. The second common standard is to ask, ""How happy are the people in a given country or region""?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKKs1rqdlmo
AmartyaSen #1 on Capabilities,"But Sen makes the point that happiness is an extremely subjective thing to judge. It is very hard to say who is happy and who is not. Finally, some philosophers, some observers suggest a basic need standard for a developing economy. Look at a region and ask, ""Do people in that place have their basic needs satisfied""? But which needs are basic and which are not basic?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKKs1rqdlmo
AmartyaSen #1 on Capabilities,"Sen has stressed the point that the basic needs standard is about what you send people, not about what they can do with what they have been sent. So, for all these reasons, Sen has rejected 'Wealth', 'Happiness' and basic needs as the best standards for a good outcome. What then? Sen suggests the notion of capabilities. Capabilities as a positive option.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKKs1rqdlmo
AmartyaSen #1 on Capabilities,Which are the choices that people have which they are free to realize. What are the things they can do? What is within their grasp? What kind of lives do they have? What kind of possible achievements can they choose from?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKKs1rqdlmo
AmartyaSen #1 on Capabilities,"This is Sen's notion of what is a good outcome. When one outcome offers better capabilities to the citizens of her region then another, we can judge that to be the better outcome. For Sen, capabilities is an absolute concept, not a relative concept It doesn't depend upon comparing the options of one person to another, and the notion of capabilities, for Sen, also respects human diversity. That is it notes that simply sending people resources doesn't make their lives good. The question is, what can people do with those resources?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKKs1rqdlmo
AmartyaSen #1 on Capabilities,"So Sen, at one point, makes the example of a bicycle. If you send a bicycle to a person who is disabled, you haven't actually improved that person's capabilities very much, if the disabled person does not have the capacity to ride the bicycle. This is very abstract and philosophical, but what does it mean on a concrete level? Well, people disagree. But one thing is for sure: Sen developed these ideas in the 1980's, and it may have had a big impact on the United Nations Human Development Index.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKKs1rqdlmo
AmartyaSen #1 on Capabilities,"The Human Development Index doesn't only look at wealth, but it looks at life expectancy, adult literacy, and school enrollment, in judging how good an outcome is, in judging how developed a country is. Sen himself stresses that he does not have a particular or exact list in mind, for the relevant capabilities. From Sen's point of view, it is really something that an individual country or region needs to choose using a democratic process. But other people who have been influenced by Sen have talked quite a bit about what the capabilities should be. Some philosophers have suggested: health, play, imagination, gender equality, autonomy, freedom of speech, all as being possibly important parts of the capabilities concept.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKKs1rqdlmo
AmartyaSen #1 on Capabilities,"Where do we stand with this? The critics say that Sen's notion of capabilities make some sense, but it is very hard to operationalize. We do have one operationalization: the UN Development Index, it remains to be seen how much more useful we can make Sen's notions of capabilities. But when it comes to how do we judge whether one outcome is better than the other, it does seem that the idea of capabilities has important advantages over wealth, happiness, or basic needs.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKKs1rqdlmo
"AmartyaSen #2 ""Missing Women""","Another key contribution by Amartya Sen is the idea of the missing women, but, just let me warn you, this is going to get a little scary. Sen has raised the issue of  whether baby and prenatal girls are really receiving equal treatment and equal care from their families. In some parts of the world, it seems that sons are preferred, and that means when it comes to  medical care and attention, maybe the boys are getting a better deal. Let's look at a simple numerical comparison. If we take the United States, there are 1.05 or 1.06 girls to every boy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COidWfmNs_s
"AmartyaSen #2 ""Missing Women""","If we take China, there are 0.94 girls to every boy. In other words, the sex ratio is skewed. In the United States and in other wealthier countries, there are more young girls than young boys, but in China, it's the other way around. There are more young boys than young girls. Why would this be?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COidWfmNs_s
"AmartyaSen #2 ""Missing Women""","Sen added up some numbers in a simple manner, and this was how he did the calculation. He asked if countries like China had a boy-to-girl ratio that would be the same  as that in the United States, how many more females would there be on planet Earth? Based on these mathematics, Sen came up with the claim that there could be as many as 100 million women missing. And this is why it's called  the problem of the missing women. A hypothesis is that these women are missing because of the prenatal stage, or as baby girls, or as young children, perhaps they weren't given the same care, attention and medical treatment as was received by the young boys.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COidWfmNs_s
"AmartyaSen #2 ""Missing Women""","That's a pretty scary thought. I'll get back to those numbers in a moment, but what are some potential solutions to this problem? First is to improve female education and second is to improve female employment opportunities. That may improve the quality of norms in society regarding the treatment of females. Sen showed that in those parts of the world where female education and employment are better, that this problem of the missing women tends to be much weaker or is absent altogether.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COidWfmNs_s
"AmartyaSen #2 ""Missing Women""","Sen, for instance, looked at the Indian state of Kerala which has a pretty good  educational system, a high level of literacy, and a better situation of women's rights than in many other developing regions. And he found that in Kerala there is not, in general, this problem of the missing women. These solutions are, in general, considered to be very good ideas. That all said, since the calculation of the 100 million missing women, is considered to be problematic once we look at the exact numbers. Most scholars agree  there's a serious problem in this area, but Sen's basic calculation assumed that each region has an identical initial ratio  of male-to-female births, and this simply isn't true.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COidWfmNs_s
"AmartyaSen #2 ""Missing Women""","There are some parts  of the world where, at birth, there are more baby girls than baby boys and other parts where there are, at birth, more baby boys than baby girls. Once we take this difference  into account in the calculation, the number of missing women is not 100 million, it's probably a good deal less. There's a very good piece  by Anderson and Ray, published in 2010, Review of Economic Studies, it's called ""Missing Women: Age and Disease"". They show that disease-by-disease effects account for most of the missing women around the world. That is, if there were missing women  in a particular region, it's probably because in that region,  there is some disease to which women, whether they be baby girls  or grown women, are more prone.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COidWfmNs_s
"AmartyaSen #2 ""Missing Women""","So what they have done in this article is go through different parts of the world, and show which diseases  are giving rise to the missing women, and at what ages these women are going missing. Let's take a look at what they have learned from this piece. If we look at China, this is the case where Sen's argument seems to be most clearly true. Most of the missing women in China are from prenatal factors or from infancy. That is the sex ratio between  girls and boys opens up in China at a very early age.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COidWfmNs_s
"AmartyaSen #2 ""Missing Women""","This seems to fit Sen's scenario of the case where parents aren't paying enough attention  and giving enough care to the baby girls compared  to the baby boys, or there may be a kind of selective abortion going on where the parents are kinder  to have baby boys than baby girls. But the interesting thing  is that only in China does this seem to be the case. In other regions, the problem  of the missing women actually takes a different form. If we look at India, it seems that cardiovascular disease is actually the main culprit in the missing-women problem. The sex ratio opens up to be  quite large for women at older ages because of heart disease.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COidWfmNs_s
"AmartyaSen #2 ""Missing Women""","So it's a very different story  than one we might tell about China. If we look at Sub-Saharan Africa, the story about the different sex ratio, yet again, seems to be about disease. Malaria is one important disease, but most of all, HIV/AIDS accounts for the biggest chunk  of the missing-women problem in Africa. That is, there are fewer women, but it's because women, typically at older ages, are dying from HIV/AIDS  at a higher rate than the men are. So it's not a problem of children or babies being neglected at birth, it's the differential incidence of this particular disease.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COidWfmNs_s
"AmartyaSen #2 ""Missing Women""","Interestingly, if you read Sen, he doesn't account for there being a missing-women problem in Sub-Saharan Africa at all. It turns out however, when we adjust for the different sex ratios at birth, the missing-women problem is especially severe in Sub-Saharan Africa. It simply tends to come from HIV/AIDS and, to a lesser extent, malaria. What's the upshot? It's commonly agreed that the missing-women problem is very serious.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COidWfmNs_s
"AmartyaSen #2 ""Missing Women""","Sen's number of 100 million seems to be a considerable exaggeration, but even a much smaller number would be a very large number indeed. It's interesting that if you go back and look at history, look at the United States. The United States had a missing women problem in the year 1900, and in proportional terms,  it was actually a more severe problem than either China or India have today. It's not the common view  that American parents were neglecting their baby girls in the year 1900. But, again, it seems it might have something to do with the differential  incidence of disease.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COidWfmNs_s
"AmartyaSen #2 ""Missing Women""","Let's consider a quotation from the Anderson and Ray paper. They say, and I quote, ""Sen's terrible story of inequality and neglect is possibly true in large part, but other stories need to be told as well"".",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COidWfmNs_s
Child Labor,"Now, let's consider the economics of child labor. Estimates vary and, in any case, they're very rough. But it's possible that over 200 million children in the world are working today. Some good news is that rates of  child labor are falling over time, as you can see in this picture, with the lines representing  the different major regions of the world. And the falls are substantial.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAjwX6ufGq4
Child Labor,"If we look at the line, for instance, for Africa, at about 1950 the rate of  child labor in Africa was almost 40 %. But as of 2010, we can see that it's somewhat below 25 %. This picture very much shows  that rates of child labor are declining with wealth. That is, once parents have enough money and they are sure the family is able to eat, they don't really want to  send their children to work. This is one of the many good things  about being a wealthier society.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAjwX6ufGq4
Child Labor,"Here's evidence from Vietnam showing again that child labor tends  to decline with wealth. From 1993 to 1997, Vietnam grew at a rate of about 6 to 7 %. Over that same period, child labor went down by about 28 %. What else do we know  about child labor. Some of these may be  a little surprising.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAjwX6ufGq4
Child Labor,"First, most children that work are employed by their parents. Second, most of these children  work in agriculture. Third, most children that work  actually also attend school, although by no means do they all. And finally, child labor is highly  responsive to negative income shocks, that is, if you have a very poor family  and something very bad happens to them such as a bad harvest, then they may send  the children out to work. One argument is that  the best way out of child labor is simply for a society  to become wealthier and then the children will not  be sent so much to work.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAjwX6ufGq4
Child Labor,"But there's another point of view which suggests that, in the meantime, the law can bring about an improvement. Let's think about how  this argument might work. In one version of this view, in the labor market, there are multiple equilibria, one of them is here  and another of them is here. And to think about what  that might mean intuitively, here's how that goes. Imagine that you passed  a law banning child labor, that would limit the number of  individuals in the workforce, it might raise wages somewhat, and perhaps if all of  the children cease working family wages will be higher and it won't be necessary to  send the children out to work.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAjwX6ufGq4
Child Labor,"But for this to be successful perhaps you have to ban  child labor across the board. We don't know if this argument is true, but it is an argument that has been  made for banning child labor outright and not simply waiting for  societies to become wealthier. Another argument for banning  child labor outright is called the child labor trap, and that goes this way: The claim is it's not efficient  to send children out to work, ideally it would make more sense to educate the child and then have the child pay parents  back overtime with later earnings. But maybe that kind of arrangement  cannot be enforced unless the parents get what  they can out of the child which is to make the child work now. That means when the child grows up, the child, then as a parent, is not educated and is much poorer and that individual will in turn  send his or her children out to work, and you're stuck in  a series of generations where each generation sends  the children out to work.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAjwX6ufGq4
Child Labor,"But if you could somehow snap  this spring by banning child labor and the children then get more educated, well, it could be the case that the whole  series of generations would be better off. For this argument to be true of course, you probably do need a fairly good educational opportunity for those children. Other economists have argued that laws against child labor actually can be counterproductive and  might even lead to more child labor. Here's a way to think about it. If you pass a law banning child labor, that means employers of  child labor take on more risk.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAjwX6ufGq4
Child Labor,"But as we see in the real world, very often the practice still continues. But what happens is that  the children who are working, they are now paid lower wages  because hiring them involves greater risk. Those children are paid lower wages, the families are then poorer, they have lower income, and they're at the verge of subsistence. So how do they respond? They respond by actually increasing  the labor supply of the other children and sending even more  children out to work because they need to  do so to continue to eat.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAjwX6ufGq4
Child Labor,"Of these three different  mechanisms I've outlined, I would stress that we don't yet know how true each one of them may be. There are many interesting papers on child labor, but note that data  in this area, good data, they're really quite hard to come by. But you can read all of these online and note also the first one listed by Basu is the source of the first figure in this video. An excellent survey piece is this one listed here, also online, and note it's the source for our second and third figures in this video. Child labor is an important issue.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAjwX6ufGq4
Child Labor,"It's very important to think analytically about it and not just emotionally, but it's also very hard to do. Nonetheless, this is an introduction to some of the leading issues.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAjwX6ufGq4
Bonded Labor,"Now let's consider the economics of  what is sometimes called bonded labor. Bonded labor occurs when a laborer  signs away his rights to an employer and almost becomes a kind of slave in the longer term. Sad to say, it's a pretty widespread practice. There are about 18 to 20 million bonded laborers today. Well over 80% of them are in South Asia, and in South Asia, this represents  more than 1% of the population.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mJW4IA3ZGs
Bonded Labor,"There are, by the way,  two common subcategories within the idea of bonded labor. One of them is debt bondage, when an individual turns himself over  to his or her employer because he or she cannot pay off a debt, and also child labor as bonded labor. In that case, it may not  be voluntary at all, but rather it's the parents selling the child and the labor of the child to an employer. By the way, when it comes to debt bondage in South Asia, quite commonly the amounts of  money at stake are really quite small, typically in the neighborhood  of about 150 U.S. dollars. Bonded laborers work in many sectors, but some especially common jobs involve working with brick kilns, in stone quarries, with cotton handlooms, and also, in the case of children, carpet weaving.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mJW4IA3ZGs
Bonded Labor,"For many women,  and also some boys in addition, bonded labor as prostitution  is a serious issue. So what are some reasons for bonded labor? You'll note of course that bonded labor is especially common in very poor societies. One cause is that you have some number of individuals who, because of their poverty, become quite desperate and sign up for bonded labor simply as some kind of mistake. They give up on holding out  for a better future.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mJW4IA3ZGs
Bonded Labor,"Another possibility has to do with imperfect credit markets and this is especially likely  when it's debt-related bonded labor. Imagine owing someone, say, 150 or 200 dollars and  not having the money to pay it off. Well, one way you might pay off that debt is by signing up as a laborer and  that indeed may relieve your debt. You would be better off if you could simply borrow that money and pay it back later, but that's not always possible. If the level of capital accumulation  is very low and it's a very poor region, it could just be that the normal wage  is below a level of subsistence.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mJW4IA3ZGs
Bonded Labor,"Individuals then would  rather sign up for slavery rather than die or go hungry. Note that if you've effectively  been enslaved to an employer, that employer might have an incentive to feed you enough just to keep you around and working. Finally, bonded labor may represent a form of insurance or wage smoothing. So, let's imagine that you can be offered a wage today, but you're not sure what your offered wages will be in the future, and you are afraid that  you might starve or earn very little. You might agree to an arrangement where your wages, over future periods, are guaranteed, albeit at a very low level, but in return, you have  to give up your freedom.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mJW4IA3ZGs
Bonded Labor,"Of course, none of these  are happy arrangements, but you should note that sometimes the alternatives to bonded labor can be even worse. Bonded labor does survive for a reason. It's a very ugly and arguably  morally offensive practice, but still, the solution is not simply  to rail against bonded labor, but rather to cure the conditions  which gave rise to it in the first place. So what to do about bonded labor? Well, some good reforms would be greater education, which is  a good idea for many different reasons, greater access to microcredit, and do see our videos on the microcredit topic.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mJW4IA3ZGs
Bonded Labor,"Notice that if bonded labor arises  because credit markets are imperfect; if you give people greater  chances to borrow, they might simply borrow money rather than agreeing to a bonded labor contract. Finally, there's land reform. The people who sign up for bonded labor very often do not have access to land. If they had this asset,  through land reform, then again, the amount of bonded labor probably would go down. Another possible solution is to have tougher restrictions on bonded labor and stronger laws against bonded labor, but note that in an economic perspective this isn't always going to work.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mJW4IA3ZGs
Bonded Labor,"You'll notice that India has numerous laws and restrictions on bonded labor, dating from at least the 1970s, but still, bonded labor continues in India. Part of the problem is that, if wages and productivity levels truly are low, simply passing laws against bonded labor; well that's addressing a symptom  rather than the cause. What we need to do is to get up  the wages and productivity of labor, and simply passing a law  does not automatically do that. This is a very sad and tragic topic, and it deals with some of the most extreme sufferers in developing economies today. But it's very important, and if  you'd like to read more about it, I recommend a very good book  by Kara called simply Bonded Labor.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mJW4IA3ZGs
Bonded Labor,"Online, there's a good article,  Bonded Labor in India, and in general, you can just Google ""bonded labor"" to a wide variety of sources.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mJW4IA3ZGs
"Randomized Controlled Trials, Part One","Hi. Today, we're going to be looking at  randomized controlled trials, some of their advantages,  some of their disadvantages, and how they relate to  observational studies. In later lectures, we'll give you  some specific examples of these trials applied to development. Today is going to be an overview. Let's get going.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OP-XfURQ2UY
"Randomized Controlled Trials, Part One","So, what is a randomized controlled trial? The basic ideas are pretty simple. We begin with a population of  interest or one of availability; I'll talk a little bit more about  that latter point somewhat later. We're then going to pick somebody from this population. Let's suppose this guy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OP-XfURQ2UY
"Randomized Controlled Trials, Part One","We then flip a coin. If the coin comes up heads, we're going to put that person in what we're going to call the treatment group. If the coin comes up tails, we put the person in the control group. Let's suppose our first person ends up in the treatment group. We then do the same thing again.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OP-XfURQ2UY
"Randomized Controlled Trials, Part One","Perhaps, on the second time, the person ends up in the control group. We keep going like this,  flipping a coin every time, until we have a sufficiently large treatment and control group. Now, what do I mean by sufficiently large? What do I mean is, large enough so that we are confident,  to within a small probability, that these groups  are statistically identical, that these groups are  statistical doppelgangers. They are similar in all respects, both in observed characteristics  and in unobserved characteristics.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OP-XfURQ2UY
"Randomized Controlled Trials, Part One","The mathematics of statistics tell us how large these groups have to be in order to get our confidence up to whatever rate we want. So, these groups; we make them large enough so that they are statistically identical. That's important because, now, what we do for the treatment group; we give them some treatment. For example, perhaps, we give them bednets. Because randomization has  made these groups identical, the only difference is that  one group has the treatment and one group does not.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OP-XfURQ2UY
"Randomized Controlled Trials, Part One","So, now we follow these groups over time and we observe the difference  that the treatment makes. Perhaps, for example, we measure mortality rates in the two groups. By the way, when this experiment has been done in India and in Africa, with bednets, it's found that the mortality rate  among the group given bednets is indeed significantly lower than  the group without the bednets, particularly for children  under the age of five. That's one example of a randomized control trial from development. Okay.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OP-XfURQ2UY
"Randomized Controlled Trials, Part One",Why would we want to do this? Why do we want to go through all this trouble? That's what a randomized control trial is. What are the advantages? Why are we doing this?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OP-XfURQ2UY
"Randomized Controlled Trials, Part One","Let's take a look. Randomized controlled trials  have significant advantages, but they can also be quite expensive, which is one reason why the tradition in most of social science has not been to use randomized controlled trials, but has been to use multivariate regression in an observational study. Now, the idea of an observational study  is to take data which has been collected; usually for some other reason, say, by the government in the census; and to try and use that data  and statistical techniques to answer your question of interest. So, something like this equation  has probably appeared in millions of papers in the social  sciences and elsewhere. It's a multivariate regression.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OP-XfURQ2UY
"Randomized Controlled Trials, Part One","Suppose, for example, we're interested in studying the effect of a job training  program on income. So, Y would be our outcome  of interest, in this case income. T would be a variable denoting whether  the person was treated or not; 0 or 1, 1 if they entered the job training program. Then, all these X's are control variables. So, these X's are all of the other things which might affect income other than the treatment program itself.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OP-XfURQ2UY
"Randomized Controlled Trials, Part One","So, for example, you might  include the workers age, the workers experience level, the geographic location of the worker. All kinds of other things as well. Now, if you've included all of  the major control variables, then you can use statistics to deduce  what's the effect of the treatment. However, if you fail to include  some important control variables, which end up buried here  in the error term. And if the control variables,  which you have failed to include; if they're correlated with whether  the worker has been treated or not; then your estimate of the effect of  the treatment on income will be biased, will be mismeasured.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OP-XfURQ2UY
"Randomized Controlled Trials, Part One","Now, this problem was understood at a theoretical level for a very long time. However, more recently, we've managed to compare  randomized controlled trials with the results of observational studies and the differences have  been quite shocking. Let me tell you a story about this. The story I want to tell you about is a true story about a former British colony. The healers in this former colony had what seemed like a strange belief.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OP-XfURQ2UY
"Randomized Controlled Trials, Part One","They believed that the urine of pregnant mares had great healing properties. Specifically, when distilled down to a powder, they believed that pregnant mares urine could make older women more youthful, more feminine, and that the powder would ward off disease. The healers in this former colony  were very highly respected, and many women followed  their advice and took the powders. After many years, however,  a new group of healers decided to test this theory. They did so using  a randomized controlled trial.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OP-XfURQ2UY
"Randomized Controlled Trials, Part One","And they discovered that pregnant  mares' urine didn't reduce disease, instead it caused heart attacks,  dementia, and breast cancer. Now, the most shocking  thing about this story, is that the former British colony that I am talking about is the United States. And the results from the randomized controlled trials were announced in just 2002. The drug I'm talking about, was called Premarin, pregnant mares urine, and it was an estrogen treatment which was prescribed as a treatment  of hormone replacement therapy. Many women took this hormone replacement therapy and the arguments for it were not crazy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OP-XfURQ2UY
"Randomized Controlled Trials, Part One","For example, it had long been known that women had much lower rates of heart disease than men until they hit menopause. And then, during menopause, their rates of heart disease quickly caught up to those of men. Now, during menopause,  estrogen declines tremendously. So, the argument was that, with  this hormone replacement therapy, you could actually ward off heart disease. Moreover, this wasn't just a theory.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OP-XfURQ2UY
"Randomized Controlled Trials, Part One","In observational studies, it was discovered that women  on hormone replacement therapy, in fact, did have lower rates  of heart disease. They also had lower rates of incontinence, lower rates of depression, lower rates of Alzheimer's. One negative was that they did have  higher rates of breast cancer. But, when calculating the total mortality rate, it was suggested that hormone replacement therapy would actually reduce mortality which is why many women took  hormone replacement therapy and, in fact, it became  a standard prescription for women entering menopause. Not everyone was convinced however, and it was decided; since so many people, so many women, were on  hormone replacement therapy; that it would be a good idea to  do a randomized controlled trial.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OP-XfURQ2UY
"Randomized Controlled Trials, Part One","This actually was controversial, because some people said, ""Look. ""The evidence is so strong in favour of HRT that to do a trial would be unethical"". But the trial went ahead  with 16,000 women. This is the Women's Health Initiative. Women were randomly assigned  to either get the treatment, the hormone replacement therapy,  or to get placebo.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OP-XfURQ2UY
"Randomized Controlled Trials, Part One","And what was discovered,  over time, was shocking. The women who got  the hormone replacement therapy had higher rates of heart attack, higher rates of breast cancer, higher rates of dementia. This really shocked the medical profession and people began to ask, ""How could the results of  the randomized control trial be so different from  the observational studies""? Now, even though the observational studies controlled for all kinds of factors, you know, age and race and  so forth, lots and lots of things, it was discovered that the women who took the hormone replacement therapy; they had more access to the health system, they tended to be wealthier, they tended to be better educated, they tended to be more  interested in prevention. And, so, they were probably  doing a lot of other things which, in combination,  reduced their heart attack rates.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OP-XfURQ2UY
"Randomized Controlled Trials, Part One","But, it wasn't the hormone  replacement therapy, which was reducing the heart attack rates, it was all the other things that women  who got the hormone replacement therapy, who chose the hormone replacement therapy. It was all the other things that these women were doing which reduced the heart attack rate. When you looked, however,  at randomly assigned groups, it was clear that HRT  was actually a very bad idea. In fact, looking retrospectively, it's now estimated that because  so many additional women were taking the hormone  replacement therapy, that there may have been as many as 200,000 additional cases of breast cancer than there otherwise would have been. This really indicates the importance of randomized controlled trials.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OP-XfURQ2UY
Private Health Insurance,">> Let's now turn to the topic of why  private health insurance is relatively rare in the poorer developing nations. We need to distinguish carefully between insurance for income and insurance for healthcare expenses. Insurance for income is quite common in developing nations. That is, when something bad happens to an individual, perhaps family members friends and neighbors help out that individual in any number of ways, including with aid and also with loans. But insurance for health- care expenses follows a much more concrete model.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U4LnoojNus
Private Health Insurance,"The model for healthcare insurance is this: that an individual has some kind of sickness or injury, visits a doctor,  the doctor charges the individual a price, and then the insurance company reimburses for the price for that medical service. Of course in return for this reimbursement the individual is paying premiums up front to the insurance company. Now there are  cases in developing nations where we find this model, but for the most part, it's relatively rare. Let's think about why that might be. First, if the poor individual is paying  premiums up front to an insurance company.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U4LnoojNus
Private Health Insurance,"In essence, that individual is acting as a creditor toward the company. There is money being advanced now under the  possibility that perhaps later on that individual will become sick and will in some manner be repaid through benefits but nonetheless, the policyholder, the poor individual is acting as a kind of creditor to the company. Now if we look at the economic positions taken by these poor individuals more generally, in general they do not act as creditors but rather they act as debtors. If we look at micro- credit markets, they will even pay quite high rates of interest on an annualized  basis. Say 50 or 100 percent to borrow, so the insurance contract is putting them in the position of being a creditor instead of being a borrower, and that doesn't make natural economic sense.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U4LnoojNus
Private Health Insurance,"A second problem with the insurance model for many developing nations is that in general, the level of corruption is too high, and the level of trust is too low. This problem can take at least two forms. The first is that if you were asking poor individuals to advance money to an insurance company, those individuals simply may not trust the company to ever really give them their money back. A second problem is that the insurance  company may not sufficiently trust the doctors. Let's say a poor individual goes to the doctor with a sprained finger, and the doctor and the patient get  together and collude and say ""hey, you have a sprained finger, that's a minor problem.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U4LnoojNus
Private Health Insurance,"Why don't we say you had a broken finger or a broken arm, or a broken leg, and that you had to pay me a large sum of money, and then I will charge the insurance company for a larger reimbursement, and we will somehow share those gains. Unless there's a fair degree of trust in doctors, and or the ability to monitor such problems, the insurance company  will be reluctant to proceed with this open-ended promise to reimburse for medical expenses. Again, I stress, there is a lot of insurance in these settings. The insurance simply doesn't take the form of direct reimbursement for healthcare expenses. So what forms does the insurance take?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U4LnoojNus
Private Health Insurance,"Well, one possibility is simply that there may be a lot of pooling of risk in poorer societies. So a few have high healthcare expenses in a given period, you will be helped out by friends, families and neighbors. Presumably these individuals can monitor  fraud or the possibility of phony claims better than an insurance company could. What else? There is also very much the the option of loans, so if you have very high healthcare expenses in a given period, what you can do is simply borrow more money.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U4LnoojNus
Private Health Insurance,"If you've borrowed money to pay for health care this will mean that in the future, you'll have to work especially hard to pay off those loans, but you may prefer that burden to the alternative of having to pay a lot of insurance premiums up front. In general, information on this topic is fairly scattered, but if you'd like to start, you can go to the Banerjee and Duflo book ""Poor Economics"", they discuss some problems with healthcare insurance. And also just Google: ""Health insurance developing countries"".",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U4LnoojNus
Deworming,"Worms are one of the most serious health problems in the developing world, especially among children. Worms affect about 600 million school-aged children around the world and they're known to cause diarrhea,  anemia, internal bleeding, malnutrition, and numerous other ailments. They're parasites and  they stunt physical growth and also mental growth and intelligence. They sap energy and, sometimes, children end up  too weak to even attend school. A lot of worms are transmitted by soil, so poor people who live  in unsanitary conditions or when there are children who walk around and not wear shoes as they're supposed to, they are especially vulnerable to worms.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12fpVXaTopA
Deworming,"You'll note, by the way, we didn't actually want to show you a picture of a real worm, so this is mostly a picture of an apple. The good news is that worms can be treated and they can be treated fairly cheaply. For instance, there's a chewable pill that can be given to children and it costs about  50 cents per child per year to distribute enough pill so that the children,  for the most part, don't get worms. The pill basically flushes the worms out of the body. There is a very good paper on  the economics of deforming children by Baird, Hicks, Kramer, and Miguel,  it's called worms at work.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12fpVXaTopA
Deworming,"They look at two groups of individuals where one of the groups received two to three more years of deworming than the comparison group. They found the group that had  the extra deworming had, by the time they were 19 to 26 years old, earnings that were 21 to 29% higher, hours worked that were 12% higher, and workdays lost to illness found by a third. Of course, those are notable gains. Total years and school, test scores,  and also self-reported health are much better for the group  that had the additional deworming. This suggests that education and health are plausible channels for how  the deworming led to higher earnings and higher work hours.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12fpVXaTopA
Deworming,"The authors of this paper conclude there are very high social  returns to deworming. This was the study from Kenya  and, in that context, they estimated that the ratio of benefits to costs for deworming children was somewhere between 24 to 41. That is, for every dollar spent on deworming there would be the equivalent of 24 to 41 dollars  worth of gains in return. Of course, it remains a question why deworming is not more common if it's so effective and, indeed, it seems to be this effective. Factors cited include lack of awareness of the problem, lack of advocacy, and, in general, good decentralized institutions  at the local level in rural areas which are committed to deworming children.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12fpVXaTopA
Deworming,"Nonetheless, on this issue, progress is being made.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12fpVXaTopA
Pricing Mosquito Nets,"We're going to look at whether it's better to give away mosquito nets or sell them. And in the process, we'll consider a concept which economist's call elasticity of demand. For some general background, in the year 2002, the World Health Organization estimated that about a quarter of young children's deaths in Africa were due to malaria. Malaria was also responsible for over 1 million African deaths a year. Malaria, of course,  is carried by mosquitoes.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64AlDDGWJPM
Pricing Mosquito Nets,"A partial solution to this problem  is given by the bed net. If you're sleeping under a bed net, to some extent you are  protected from mosquitoes. It's all the more effective if that bed net has been laced or treated with insecticide. One problem, however, is that the rate of uptake on bed nets, in many parts of Africa, is fairly low. One study of Kenya found that  only about 20% of households had the bed nets at all, and, when it came to effective use,  looking at children 5 years of age or younger, only about 5% of those children were  actually being protected by the bed nets.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64AlDDGWJPM
Pricing Mosquito Nets,"If you're running a charitable program, one question is whether you should be giving away the bed nets completely for free, or whether you should simply be heavily subsidizing the price of those bed nets, say, to the rate of about 80 or 90%. It turns out that it makes a really big difference if the bed nets are free altogether. When the bed nets are  given away absolutely for free, the rate of uptake is about 99% and, of course, that's quite a high figure. Alternatively, let's say that a very small price is charged for the bed nets, in the equivalent terms of U.S. dollars, this price would be around 75 cents. And when the price for  a bed net is 75 cents, what happens is that the demand for bed nets goes down quite a bit.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64AlDDGWJPM
Pricing Mosquito Nets,"In fact it goes down by about 75%, so many fewer bed nets end up being used. Economists would say that, in this case, demand is relatively elastic and the general lesson is that sometimes making something altogether free really does make a big difference for demand, and in this case, ultimately, the health of the children,  the health of the population, and the fight against malaria. To read more on this topic and to see exactly where these estimates come from, I recommend these two pieces, both of which are available online.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64AlDDGWJPM
Participation in Uganda,"Let's now consider how community participation can affect the success of health care programs, turning to an example from Uganda. Among economists, there are  two quite distinct views as to whether and how much talk affects economic outcomes. Under an older and more hard-nosed view, what really matters is the material  incentives at play in any given situation. Talk is quite literally  a kind of cheap talk, something people say, but without really changing much in terms of the final equilibrium. It's a more common view today  that talk can matter a great deal, because when it comes to social norms, those social norms need to be defined,  communicated and enforced, and talk does all of these things.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6etXs8fF8c
Participation in Uganda,"As it turns out, the study  we're looking at, will be supporting the view  that talk really matters. And this was a study  that took place in Uganda. The study involved  a randomized control trial, 50 different communities were studied, the researchers looked at  public dispensaries for healthcare and those are usually rural. In the communities given the treatment, the goal was to increase community  participation in healthcare services. So, that meant facilitating village  and staff and council meetings all about what could be done to provide better healthcare  services in these communities.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6etXs8fF8c
Participation in Uganda,"In essence, the goal was to hold  meetings and have some talk, and, over time, initiate community-based monitoring of healthcare services. Ideally, individuals in  these communities would all of a sudden  become better monitors of when they're getting what they're supposed to be getting. That might sound like  a big wasted effort, but it turned out  that these treatments are, compared to the control  communities, fairly effective. So, the empirical results found, in the communities  receiving the treatment, there was a 33% reduction in under five mortality, which is significant, overall birth weight improves, waiting time to get care is down, quite significantly, in the dispensaries,  absenteeism of workers is down and that's down by 13 percentage points. The healthcare clinics are cleaner and, overall, people in  these communities are making fewer visits  to traditional healers because it seems, they're now more interested in the healthcare services.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6etXs8fF8c
Participation in Uganda,"It seems that the talk  really changed the norms and the norms in turn really  changed the healthcare outcomes. Of course, holding all these council and village meetings does have a cost, but the researchers estimate that, given the positive returns to the activity, that it's costing about 300 US dollars to save the life of one child under five. The study under consideration  is listed here -- and it's called,  ""Power to the People: Evidence from a Randomized Field Experiment on Community-Based  Monitoring in Uganda"". I recommend also that you view  our video unit on Elinor Ostrom who researched the power of small groups to produce local public goods.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6etXs8fF8c
The Quality of Medical Advice,"When it comes to developing nations, very often the quality of medical advice and service are among the biggest problems. Contrary to some common impressions, access is not itself always problematic. For instance, in urban India, a typical person will average  5 doctor visits per year. You can compare this to the USA  where the average is 3.15 doctor visits a year. Obviously, that's not a problem of access per se.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYZeBFcN6Aw
The Quality of Medical Advice,"The problem perhaps is that not all doctors are as wise or as benevolent as maybe  this person pictured here. Researchers found this very typical case in India. The individual had had only  a six month long distance course in Ayurvedic medicine. That doctor saw about 200 patients a day, he spent about 3.5 minutes per patient. And, at the end, what he typically did is simply crushed some pills for them and sent them away.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYZeBFcN6Aw
The Quality of Medical Advice,"Or we could look at some more  systematic information about the Indian city of Delhi which, of course, is the country's capital. In that setting, it was found that when parents brought in their children for possible risk of diarrhea, that the doctors, well, only about 25% asked about blood in the stool which is one of the first questions  that typically would be asked, only 49% of the doctors asked  whether the child had a fever and only 7% of the doctors checked for a depression in the skull of the child which is considered to be  a good test of dehydration. Diarrhea, of course,  is a very common ailment, so it seems those doctors simply  weren't performing very well. If we move away from India, we also can find problematic results in Tanzania in Africa. A study of Tanzania found that doctors there, on average, complete less than 1/4 of  the essential checklist for patients with symptoms of malaria.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYZeBFcN6Aw
The Quality of Medical Advice,"A related and additional problem  in many countries is that many of individuals do not even  visit doctors in the first place, but they may go to something like a shaman, or a witch doctor, or a faith healer where the standards of care are probably not even up to what we are measuring for the doctors. In general, the main problems are not that some patients are treated better than other patients by the same doctor, but rather the problems are quite systemic and they come from the doctors  not being great in the first place. Those problems include absenteeism, what you might call variation  in competence across doctors and incompetent doctors appear to behave incompetently for all of their patients, variation in effort across doctors, and also it seems that, on average, public sector clinics are often  somewhat worse than private clinics even when both are bad. And this may be because public sector  clinic doctors are very often simply on a fixed salary and they want to get patients out  the door as quickly as possible. You add up all these problems  and, again, we're back to the quality of medical care  very often simply not being very good.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYZeBFcN6Aw
The Quality of Medical Advice,"The source on these numbers, the best single article to read and also a general survey of the field can be found in this article by Das, Hammer and Leonard, ""The Quality of Medical Advice  in Low-Income Countries,"" and it's available, free and online.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYZeBFcN6Aw
The Kerala Paradox,"Today we're going to talk about Kerala, a state in the southwest of India By the way here's a picture of a boat trip in Kerala, a lot of tourists do this. If you'd like to see where Kerala is on the map it's right down here, the light green state. The so called Kerala paradox is that  Kerala has been a relatively poor state of India, but it has social indicators  which in some important regards are well in advance of much of the rest of India. Some of the social indicators are really quite good, even compared to parts of the developed world. Just to give a few examples, literacy in  Kerala is measured at about 92%, compared to about 52% for the rest of India, and  of course that's a large gap.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVgb7-Lhd6A
The Kerala Paradox,"If we look at infant mortality it's about 17 out of 1000 in Kerala, and in the rest of India it's a much higher 85 out of 1000 Life expectancy for males in Kerala, it's  about 68, and the rest of India it averages about 63. It's an even larger gap for females, where in Kerala it's 74, and the rest of India it's about 64, a full 10 years less. Finally, rates of fertility in Kerala are much lower, measured per woman we have here about 20 per 1000, compared to the  average for the rest of India being about 31 per 1000. What are the causes of this, well it's  going to turn out to be a complex story, but right off the bat one cause is that  social development expenditures in Kerala are higher in general then in the  rest of India. For instance in Kerala those expenditures are about 1/3 higher than a simple model of per capita income would predict.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVgb7-Lhd6A
The Kerala Paradox,"It also seems to be the case that people  actually expect reasonable quality of social services from their government. Still we shouldn't focus on just public sector expenditures For instance in urban parts of Kerala, about 64% of healthcare expenditures are private, and in rural parts of Kerala about 60% of healthcare expenditures are private. It's also interesting to look at the ratio of private to public spending on healthcare in Kerala. In Kerala that ratio is about 9x, that is much more private spending, for the rest of India that ratio is about  4x, so Kerala is showing an especially high preponderance of private spending on healthcare. This is an estimate taken from a paper by Arvent Pannecheria.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVgb7-Lhd6A
The Kerala Paradox,"Another interesting feature of Kerala is just how many Keralans have migrated to the gulf region to work, typically at higher salaries, and often stayed there for a while and then moved back home with a fairly high stash of wealth. In the earlier days of Indian independence Kerala really was a less wealthy than average Indian state, but in more recent times it's actually become more wealthy than average, in part due to these remittances and due to labor moving if only temporarily to the Persian Gulf. Remittances from abroad account for about  20% of total income in Kerala, and that's not always counted in the  statistics. Kerala now actually on average is one of  the more prosperous states in India, and it's even more prosperous if we measure wealth by how much people actually consume, rather than how much  they earn. We find also in the data that asset  ownership is at about 2x typical Indian levels, which is again a reflection of  Kerala becoming more prosperous.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVgb7-Lhd6A
The Kerala Paradox,"So there is still a paradox in Kerala having to do with the level of social indicators compared to the wealth, but this older  notion that Kerala even for India is especially poor hasn't been true for a  while. If we look at geography and look back at  history we find some features of Kerala that probably contribute to it's superior social indicators. For instance in Kerala there's generally lots of rainfall, this means that the harvest is less vulnerable, and it  to economic and social stability. It's also the case that the populations of Kerala tend to be quite accessible, this is because so frequently there is water everywhere, whether it's the coast or it is inland waterways, so the notion of there being people stuck in some distant interior, which is hard to reach with  healthcare or social services, well that's less the case in Kerala than  in many other parts of India, and in general there is so much of the state on the coast, coastal location, and there is so much water transport. Kerala is not a state which has a lot of major highways, but nonetheless it has an extensive road system, and has for a while and this makes it a more unified state, knit together with close relations of  trade, and again the distribution of social services tends to be much easier.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVgb7-Lhd6A
The Kerala Paradox,"In general in Kerala the urban vs, rural distinction is weaker than in many other parts of India, so the notion of having some very backward rural villages, which are lacking far far behind major cities, again that's less likely to be the case in Kerala than in many other parts of India. Kerala also has a history of linguistic homogeneity, and significant parts of Kerala have been a matrilineal society for centuries, and that may contribute to the superior record for social indicators when it comes to caring for women. Here's a picture of a tea plantation in  Kerala, you can see that it's quite lush, and this is reflecting the notion that  rainfall is relatively plentiful in Kerala compared to some other parts of India. There's a lot of evidence that the  superior social indicators of Kerala are rooted fairly far back in history. For instance, if we look at since 1961 in Kerala life expectancy has barely been growing at an above average rate compared to the rest of India, in other words the superior performance of the state with regards to life expectancy comes from factors which were probably present before 1961.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVgb7-Lhd6A
The Kerala Paradox,"Since 1961, literacy actually has been  growing at a lower rate than in the rest of India, for Kerala about 45% and  the rest of India it's gone up about 79%. This isn't saying that Kerala has done  anything wrong since 1961, they had a higher literacy rate, that makes it harder to grow, but again if we are looking to explain that higher literacy rate we  probably should look at some features of the state which pre-date 1961. In general Kerala has had superior literacy indicators from the time of colonialism or perhaps even earlier. Part of the paradox of Kerala is that when it comes to some social indicators the state appears to have a much worse  performance than many other parts of India For instance if we look at alcoholism, or consider rates of suicide, or rates of joblessness, and also inequality of income in all of these areas Kerala has subpar performance. It's very difficult to come up with a  unified theory that explains these areas, where Kerala when it comes to other social indicators simply isn't doing that well.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVgb7-Lhd6A
The Kerala Paradox,"Just to close, here's another very nice  picture of Kerala, again this is a picture of a boat trip. To follow up on Kerala you can do some  simple googling, such as ""Kerala social indicators"" and ""Kerala paradox"", but  here's some pieces which I found especially useful in trying to make sense of the history of Kerala. Most of them are online, except for this 1 book ""Social Development in Kerala"", but in any case these are just some  suggestions to get you started. In any case, it still seems there is  really quite a bit about the Keralan paradox which we still don't understand.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVgb7-Lhd6A
Education and Economic Growth,"What exactly are the benefits of education? This might seem like an obvious question or a trivial topic, but, in fact, it involves some very deep  economic and even philosophical issues. First of all, education increases  human capital in the labor force and that raises wages. Workers who can read and write  very well are more productive than workers who cannot. Workers who have a master's degree or  PhD degree in electrical engineering are also more productive.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-2BZOXfQ1E
Education and Economic Growth,"Furthermore, these workers  may be more innovative and innovation is one of the major drivers of economic growth. An educated workforce is also  more able to accept and use the innovations generated by others. Imagine, for instance, education helping  a worker work with computers. Many of the most important benefits of  education are often quite intangible. For instance, education seems to develop  a greater sense of conscientiousness both in the school, but also  ultimately, later, in the workplace and also in individuals' roles as citizens.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-2BZOXfQ1E
Education and Economic Growth,"If you look at our video  units on corruption, there it was found that societies  which have greater degrees of trust and greater degrees of cooperativeness can also be less corrupt. So, through these indirect channels, a well-educated society may become a less corrupt society and thus a society better able  to enjoy the fruits of economic growth. Education may also make for better voters, better informed voters, and a more involved citizenry. Work by economist Bryan Kaplan has shown that if individuals are educated, they are more likely to understand  the perspectives of economists on economic growth and act accordingly  when they get involved in politics. That may sound pretty obvious, but part of the puzzle is that  when we look at the numbers, it's surprisingly difficult to discover  what exactly is the causal connection between education and economic growth.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-2BZOXfQ1E
Education and Economic Growth,There are at least two major problems. The first is trying to figure out  cause and effect. It's obvious that wealthier nations  have more education. But did they become wealthier nations  because they're more educated or are people simply more educated  because they live in a wealthier nation? The second problem arises  once we consider that it's the quality of education which matters and not just the number of years  that a person has gone to school for.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-2BZOXfQ1E
Education and Economic Growth,"So, if it's quality of  education that matters, the problem, then, is the quality of educational institutions tends to be correlated with the quality of a lot of other institutions in a given country. So, it's difficult to figure out whether  it's the quality of education that's contributing to economic growth or the quality of institutions  in the country more generally. Pretty much everyone agrees that education yields substantial private returns for  people who undergo the education. That is, if you graduate from a good degree from a good university or college, you will earn considerably more money. But that's quite different from thinking that getting more educated for yourself is going to benefit a lot  of other people in society, and when it comes to estimating that social return from education, we are still somewhat in the dark.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-2BZOXfQ1E
Education and Economic Growth,"Sometimes, I think about the social returns to education in Michael Kremer's O-ring model. And, by the way, see Alex's video unit on the O-ring model of economic growth. Here's a way to think about how this works. That education matters, but for education to really push  a developing economy into take off, that economy has to get  a lot of other things right also. So, if that economy has improved its system of education and done everything else wrong, well, that additional quality education doesn't really matter much.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-2BZOXfQ1E
Education and Economic Growth,"Think of take-off economic growth  as a process requiring a developing nation to get 10, 20, or 30 different things right including education. So, education does really matter, it's one of the things you have to get right. But, getting education right alone might in fact yield quite small social returns. There are many different sources you can read on this topic, stretching all the way back to  the classic writings on education, from the Ancient Greeks. But, nonetheless, for a start  on some contemporary sources using economic reasoning,  I would point you to these articles.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-2BZOXfQ1E
Education and Latin Growth,"Bad educational systems  have been one reason why Latin American growth  has not been higher. Let's look at this a little more closely. If one goes back to 1960, one might have expected most of  the Latin American nations to have been star performers  in terms of economic growth. They had higher per capita incomes  than many other developing nations and, in particular, when one  looks at years of education students in Latin American countries  were receiving more years of education than was typical for most  other developing countries. The problem however has to do with  the quality of education which is received and not just the number of years.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVEu6tpaNu8
Education and Latin Growth,"So, if one looks at test scores from  Latin American nations, one finds that educational performance  and a lot of those countries is quite low especially compared to the years of  schooling which individuals are receiving. For instance, looking at those who  stayed in school until the age of 15. In Peru for instance, as many as 82% did not have  basic literacy and cognitive skills. In Brazil, as many as 66% did, again, not have basic literacy and cognitive skills including reading and writing. These problems with education  afflict the entire region.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVEu6tpaNu8
Education and Latin Growth,"We can look at something  called the PISA tests. PISA stands for Program for International Student Assessment. It tests 15-year-old students  in math, science and reading. We can look at the 59 times when a Latin American country  participated in a PISA test. On average, in these tests, there were  41.5 different countries participating and, on average, the Latin American  countries came in with the rank of 36.9 which, of course, is fairly  close toward the bottom.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVEu6tpaNu8
Education and Latin Growth,"In the 2006 cycle, there were 57 participating countries. The only time a Latin American country made it into any of the top 40 was Chile which came in 39th  for the tests of reading. These bad educational  systems really do seem to have a significant negative  impact on economic growth. If we take tradition growth models and  perform a statistical investigation, and, where data is available, put scores for math and  reading into the regressions, we find that those test scores explain  about 87% of the variation in growth rates. We need to be very careful here, we should not conclude that bad educational systems cause about 87% of the variation in growth rates.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVEu6tpaNu8
Education and Latin Growth,"In part, it will be the case that because countries are not having  a lot of economic growth, that they have bad educational systems. Nonetheless, when you try  to adjust for the fact that many poor countries  have bad institutions it still remains the case that variation  in test scores on reading and math seems to, in statistical terms,  explain a good deal of the variation in economic growth rates. It is a common view  and not just with economists but also with sociologists  and anthropologists that poor educational systems  are a critical reason for the economic underperformance  of a variety of Latin American countries. By the way, it is not well understood  why Latin American countries seem to have such  inferior educational systems. This is a topic which  awaits further research.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVEu6tpaNu8
Education and Latin Growth,"Commonly, it is considered to be  some kind of cultural factor. But, again, in terms of answers based on hard data, we simply do not know. The numbers and statistics in  this paper are drawn from this source.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVEu6tpaNu8
Vouchers in Colombia,"Let's look at the experience with  private school vouchers in Colombia. In the early 1990s, the government in Colombia  started a program which selected some  poor families by lotteries and gave out educational  vouchers to those families. The vouchers would pay for  about half of the cost of a private secondary school. The vouchers were renewable provided the students did well at school and, over the course of the program, more than a 125,000 vouchers were handed out. Since the vouchers were  handed out randomly, by lottery, comparing the voucher receiving group  to the non-voucher receiving group is a very good way to study whether  vouchers and school choice improve educational outcomes  for poorer families.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3OWIIi9ffU
Vouchers in Colombia,"A few results are clear. First, lottery winners were  15 percentage points more likely to attend private schools  rather than public schools. Second, lottery winners, on average, completed a tenth of a year or more of school the non-lottery winners. Third, lottery winners were  ten percentage points more likely than lottery losers to have  finished the eighth grade. Lottery winners also  scored higher on tests, on average, by about  0.2 standard deviations more than those who did not win the lotteries.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3OWIIi9ffU
Vouchers in Colombia,"Lottery winners were also more likely to marry late and to focus on their studies, and most of this effect comes from the lotteries which were won by female students. Finally, a look at the lottery winners, years later, showed that those who had the vouchers had substantially higher high school graduation rates than those who did not have the vouchers. The voucher winners also  did better on test scores and they appeared to have learned more. All of these results are consistent  with economic theory, namely that if schools have to compete  for the money of their students rather than receiving that money  directly from the government, the schools will work harder to do a better job teaching those students. To read more on this topic, there are several excellent papers by Joshua Angrist and co-authors.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3OWIIi9ffU
Vouchers in Colombia,You can google this term to get to those papers.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3OWIIi9ffU
Colonial Education in India,"We're going to look at the history of education in colonial India under British rule. We'll see this is not  an entirely encouraging story. Until Indian independence in 1947, educational expenditures per capita  were less than 1% of GDP. To put this in perspective,  consider the time period from 1860 to 1912. During these years, per capita expenditures on education in India were among the lowest in the world.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUl9kqE0OKQ
Colonial Education in India,"Per capita, it averaged less than  one hundredth of a pound per year. For purposes of comparison, in the Indian princely states, which were independent of British rule, it was about twice as high per capita. In Brazil and Mexico, it was about  five times as high per capita. In the other dependent British colonies, it was about eighteen times  as high, again, per capita. As late as 1911, there were fewer than three primary  schools for every ten Indian villages.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUl9kqE0OKQ
Colonial Education in India,"Educational expenditures often were  controlled by local rural district boards. These boards were comprised of both British colonial officials and local elites. It seems the local elites had a great deal of influence over how the money was spent. For instance, in districts where Brahmans were a relatively high  percentage of the population, there was more money spent on  advanced secondary schooling, but there was not more money  spent on primary schooling. In districts with a high  proportion of Brahmans, there was a greater share of  money spent on roads.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUl9kqE0OKQ
Colonial Education in India,"This may be because the Brahmans  were businessmen who wanted to get their goods to market or because the Brahmans wanted to make it easier for themselves to get to the cities. When it came to primary school education, the Brahmans already  had reasonable alternatives in the form of colonial government  schools and urban schools. So they were less interested in promoting government expenditures  on basic primary schooling. Some areas of India saw much more  spending on schooling than others. For instance in Bombay, per capita expenditures on education  were 10 times higher than in Orissa.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUl9kqE0OKQ
Colonial Education in India,"One thing is for sure, even when  there was more money spent on schooling, for the part the benefits were  not reaped by young girls. For more information on this topic, you can google to these very useful papers.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUl9kqE0OKQ
Parental Expectations from School,"One question is whether parents  in developing nations understand what exactly is the rate of return on schooling. To investigate this question, a study was performed in Madagascar. One group of parents was  taken aside and asked: What do they think is the rate of return on education? For instance, what is the distribution of educational degrees in various job categories and how much do those job categories pay? Afterwards, those same parents  were told, based on data, what is in fact the rate of return on education, namely, the distribution of  actual educational degrees in those job categories and  how much those people earn.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPxWAZh5ZLg
Parental Expectations from School,"Overall, parents were underestimating the rate of return to education. Once they had the better information  about the relationship between education,  job prospects, and earnings, it seemed that they encouraged their children to work harder. For the children overall,  test scores increased by 0.20 of a standard deviation. If we look only at those children whose parents, initially, were underestimating rates of return to education rather than all parents overall, we find that, for those children,  test scores went up by 0.37 of a standard deviation. Since it didn't cost very much  to inform the parents, it turns out that, in essence, to buy an additional year  of schooling for one child cost about only 2 dollars and 30 cents.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPxWAZh5ZLg
Parental Expectations from School,"This suggests that informing the parents about the benefits of education can pay for itself many times over. There's also some evidence  that parents tend to adopt a ""put all your eggs in one basket"" strategy when educating their children. For instance, the parents might decide which child they think is the most intelligent, or most ambitious, or has the best chance to succeed, and to do everything possible to advance the educational prospects of that child and then to neglect the other children. It turns out this does not in general maximize rates of return, that the rates of return to education are more uniform than that, and parents would do better for their children and for the whole family if they treated the children on a equal basis. Rather than just pushing one single child the parents should do more to diversify their educational investments.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPxWAZh5ZLg
Parental Expectations from School,"Please note that these results have not been replicated for the entire world over. Of course, this is often an issue  with field experiments, that you can find out something is true at a particular place and time, but it's still difficult to discern  how universal that might be as a truth, more generally, around the world.

Thoughts on Education,"This video unit should not be thought of as representing formal research and development economics. Rather, they are my own: Tyler's thoughts on education. Please treat this as speculative. Consider the case of Sweden. Today, Sweden is a wealthy country and also a well-ordered country.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrBL3cmznUY
Thoughts on Education,"It is successful by many metrics. Yet, if we go back in time; looking back through human history; Sweden was not in all periods of time a very wealthy country. It often had famines. And Swedish resources; they have some; but the resources are not impressive enough to account for Swedish economic growth. There's a sense in which the development of Sweden is virtually coeval with Swedish educational development.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrBL3cmznUY
Thoughts on Education,"That is, Swedish success  is based on human capital and it's based on a certain sense of rules of just conduct. The thing is, when you look at Sweden,  it's quite difficult to disentangle which of these habits, and norms, and practices can be thought of as education in the narrow sense and which are simply part of the broader Swedish code of success. In one sense, you can  think of good education as a kind of symptom of Swedish success. So, Sweden has some cooperative and useful social practices and a high degree of conscientiousness. Individual Swedes,  due to cultural influences, are simply very strongly impelled to become educated.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrBL3cmznUY
Thoughts on Education,"The education itself may not be the causal factor. The education itself, viewed alone, may, in some ways, seem  relatively unimportant. But when the education is viewed  as part of this broader bundle of cultural good practices, the broader bundle then seems extremely important. It's the single item which is really setting Sweden apart. Consider the following thought experiment.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrBL3cmznUY
Thoughts on Education,"Take a Swede, make that Swede extremely well-educated, say, give him or her a PhD in economics and put that swede down in a rural village in an extremely poor country with virtually no infrastructure. How much is that education worth? Well, it's probably not worth very much. Being able to do econometrics in a village which has no electricity, and no computers, and perhaps  no paper, and no writing implements; it's simply not worth much in terms of marginal return. We again see that  the education, taken alone, with nothing else going right into society, maybe simply isn't worth very much.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrBL3cmznUY
Thoughts on Education,"But, again, if we go back to this notion of thinking in terms of the broader bundle; the education, plus the infrastructure, plus the electricity, plus the communications; then the education is indeed very powerful. So, whenever we're thinking about education, there are always at least two perspectives. One is the education simply taken alone and the other is education as part of some broader cultural bundle or as part of some broader bundle of good infrastructure and good communications. And education can look correspondingly  more productive or less productive simply depending upon how you frame the question and how you think about  the relevant bundles in these societies. The trick, perhaps, is to be aware of these possible shifts in perspective and have the appropriate  degree of skepticism, but, also, the appropriate understanding of seeing a valuable contribution and realize that many writings  in the field undervalue education because they're framing the bundling in the wrong way.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrBL3cmznUY
Thoughts on Education,"And many other writings in the field are overvaluing education, again, because they're attributing all of the benefits of these broader bundles simply to education alone. We tend to see a lot of private  schooling when social capital is low. Examples of this would be rural India and, also, rural Haiti where, in many instances, large numbers of poor students attend private schools. These schools are low fee schools, they tend to have large number of teachers, and their education is certainly better than the alternative of nothing or maybe public schools where the teachers don't show up. But, typically, they are not the highest quality schools in those countries.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrBL3cmznUY
Thoughts on Education,"That's because when you view them  as embedded in this framework, the fact that private schools are necessary, that means that you're operating  in a particular regional framework of relatively low trust and  relatively low social capital. In regions where social capital is stronger, such as Northern Europe, most education tends to be supplied by the public sector. At the primary and secondary levels,  this education tends to be quite strong, but it's a mistake to make  direct comparisons of public sector educational provision and private sector educational provision. A larger role for the public sector is often symptomatic of this broad bundle where most of society, including  government and including voters, are, indeed, somewhat obsessed  with providing education and that often means it will be done through the state. In very broad terms, we've ended up with a global setting where private schools are supplying a lot of the very poorest people in the market and private schools in the form of higher education in the United States are also supplying education to the very wealthiest and best educated people in the market.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrBL3cmznUY
Thoughts on Education,"Consider Harvard, Princeton, Yale,  Stanford, and many other places. Public sector education seems to do best fitting in at that middle level in countries where there's a fairly high degree of conscientiousness and social norms stressing the importance of education. Private sector schools such as Harvard are either leaping over what the public sector can do or the poor or private sector  primary schools in India and Haiti are basically stepping in and making up for gaps where social order in certain  ways is not high enough to lead to effective public provision of education. In my view, the problem  of economic development is, in some fundamental way, actually nearly synonymous with the problem of education. But to understand that, we need to interpret education, quite broadly, as a kind of inculcation of  the appropriate social practices, trust, willingness to cooperate,  and aspiration to become wealthy and to be part of an economically successful nation.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrBL3cmznUY
Thoughts on Education,"Education is a question of building in enough presuppositions to support modern civilization  and advanced capitalism. And these presuppositions should be believed as general rules, even though, in many particular instances, they may be false or they may be delusions. This, again, means that we need to accept certain educational and social norms as a kind of absolute and adhere  to them rather more rigidly than perhaps the data themselves would indicate. We need to take education, which is simply part of  this broader practice, this broader bundle  of good social norms and elevate it to an extreme importance. In other words, we need  to embrace education, not only as a cause of progress  but as a symptom of progress.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrBL3cmznUY
Thoughts on Education,"And to treat the role of education  as a symptom of progress as perhaps equally or more important than the role of education as a cause of process. So, to go back to Michael Kramer's O-ring model, if you think of economic development as requiring 10, 20, or maybe 30 different things to go right; education is one of those things. When you have only education, but you're this educated PhD  with a degree in economics from somewhere in Sweden  and you're in a poor village, well, education isn't worth much. But, if you have all the other pieces of the puzzle, if you have good infrastructure and you have good communications facilities but your society is  not very well educated; well, you're somewhat wealthier, but you're still lacking in the ability to compete at a world-class level in a lot of sectors. Perhaps, the final lesson is that  education, in some ways, works best when people believe in it as a matter of faith and when people invest in it as a matter of faith.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrBL3cmznUY
Thoughts on Education,"This is inconsistent with a scientific  or economic perspective which is always trying to ask: What is the marginal rate of return of investing more in education or something else? It's being able to reconcile these two perspectives and see that each contains and reveals some fundamental truths about education. That is perhaps part of the wisdom of developing a broader appreciation of the role of education in economic development. Again, I stress, these are my personal thoughts and they should be considered quite speculative.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrBL3cmznUY
Conditional Cash Transfers,"Conditional cash transfers have been  a very successful anti-poverty program especially in Latin America. In Mexico, for instance, the government started a program in 1997 called Progresa later relabeled Oportunidades which quite simply means opportunities. The way it works is pretty simple. If the family sends a child to school, the family is paid some cash  if the child continues to go to school. If a family regularly sends a child  to healthcare clinics, the family is paid some cash  and possibly also some in-kind aid such as nutritional supplements.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTQUXY-BjzY
Conditional Cash Transfers,"The exact sums will vary  with circumstances but imagine payments for child ranging between say 5 to 20 dollars a month. If your household is otherwise earning only, say, a few dollars a day, that's quite a considerable amount. In theoretical terms, you can think of these programs  as being quite special in two ways. First, they target aid at the level of the individual household by using census data. And second, they are multisectoral, that is they address education,  health, and nutrition all at once.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTQUXY-BjzY
Conditional Cash Transfers,"The government tries to find out exactly who needs the aid and then to deliver it. This program is based on a lot of data at the individual family level. So, we do have a good sense of how well it's working and it seems it's working  quite well indeed. For instance, the program really has led to improved school enrollment, especially for girls. At the same time, the program  has limited child labour.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTQUXY-BjzY
Conditional Cash Transfers,"You might think it's a problem that families earn less because the children are working less, but the transfers from the program more than make up for that difference. One study found that 26% of  the cash transfer is invested by the families who receive it. After 18 months, due to those investments, agricultural income went up by almost 10%. That means the families have permanently higher standards of living due to these conditional cash transfers. Finally, the program has indeed  brought better health and nutrition for the recipient children.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTQUXY-BjzY
Conditional Cash Transfers,"The program can be thought of  as a revolution in social policy. One aspect of the program  that's not always remarked upon is simply how scientific an approach  Mexico has taken to public policy not only implementing the program but tracking the results and fine-tuning it and  improving it over time. Arguably, Mexico is, in this case, taking a more scientific approach to public policy than is often done in,  say, the United States. The idea of conditional cash transfers is one which is spreading around the world, especially  in Latin America including Chile, Colombia  and especially Brazil. Studies also indicate  it's done a good deal to lift people out of poverty in Brazil.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTQUXY-BjzY
Conditional Cash Transfers,"This is a very well studied topic,  as I mentioned, with excellent data and it's possible to test  for various controls, say, by comparing families  who receive the cash transfers with families who do not. For further reading, I would recommend that you google some of these terms.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTQUXY-BjzY
Mobile phones and literacy,"Let's now consider some of the educational benefits of mobile phones. Illiteracy is a major problem worldwide. It's estimated that about 18% of adults do not have adequate abilities to read and write. If we turn to some poorer countries,  such as Niger in West Africa, illiteracy is a larger problem yet. Overall, illiteracy in Niger  is estimated at about 71% and in some rural areas  that may get as high as 90%.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iunoTbX8KGQ
Mobile phones and literacy,"These individuals are  quite simply less productive, less able to get a manufacturing job, and less able to do a good job running their own small businesses. Enter cell phones. Cell phones, of course, have had a big impact on the world and they've had a big impact on Africa in particular. It's well known how cell phones have enabled the spread of information about market prices, but cellphones have  had another benefit. They have increased the ability and incentive of individuals to become educated and literate.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iunoTbX8KGQ
Mobile phones and literacy,"Just think about what working with the cellphone requires. It involves texting and it's a kind of writing, it involves dialing numbers  which requires some numeracy, and, also, the use of cell phones  with mobile money applications which are common in Africa; that too requires some basic facility with numbers and calculation. And now, we get to the point and the main result. There were two different programs  of adult education which were tried out in Niger, and one of those programs was with cell phones. A randomized control trial was  applied to two groups of individuals, namely education with  and without cell phones.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iunoTbX8KGQ
Mobile phones and literacy,"And what was the key result? Well, cell phones were really effective in improving the quality of education. The key result was that adult writing and math test scores were 0.19 to 0.26 standard deviations higher when education was combined with cell phones. The study found that the individuals working with cell phones put forward more effort. They also had stronger motivation; that is, they could see the payoff  to becoming educated by working better on their cell phone.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iunoTbX8KGQ
Mobile phones and literacy,"And the cell phone gave them a better ability to apply skills outside the classroom. These are all the mechanisms through which cell phone education was more effective. The bottom line is that cell phones  have a lot of different benefits. They're not all obvious on first glance. And, also, there are many  ways to educate people; not just in the classroom per se, but also by using technology and combining technology with classroom activity.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iunoTbX8KGQ
Mobile phones and literacy,The source for all this information is a very good paper listed here and available online. Maybe you can read it on your cell phone.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iunoTbX8KGQ
The Theory of the Median Voter,"Let's look at the theory  of the median voter, one stylized account of  democratic decisionmaking. In general, the evidence suggests  that democracies give us better economic policy and definitely better  human rights records. See the video on democratic  evidence for more on this topic. But still, economists do not  usually romanticize democracy. It's another decisionmaking process, and it actually has a lot of  imperfections and flaws.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z929jakmH8w
The Theory of the Median Voter,"Let's look at that more closely. Consider a simple model of  what is sometimes called, one-dimensional politics. One-dimensional politics means  you can arrange people's views on a line, where here is say the left-wing,  and here is the right-wing, and here are individuals in the center, and anyone's views fall  somewhere on this line, extreme left, center, or on the right. The people on the left-wing agree with eachother about pretty much everything: economics, foreign policy, civil liberties, as do the people on the right-wing or the people in the center. So there is one kind of general  dimension of tug of war in society under this assumption and furthermore, a particular seat in  the legislature is winner-take-all.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z929jakmH8w
The Theory of the Median Voter,"If you get one more vote,  well, that seat is yours. Those are the key assumptions here. They don't literally describe  any single, real-world country, but this is just a way of  building an abstract model, so we can get a general sense of how electoral pressures operate. Now, let's consider  the median voter theorem. The median voter is the voter  in the middle or the most centrist voter, or you could say in a way,  the most typical voter in society.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z929jakmH8w
The Theory of the Median Voter,"And here, imagine you have  a normal distribution of voters with a lot of individuals  clustered here in the center, a smaller number with more  extreme left-wing views, and a smaller number with  more extreme right-wing views. Furthermore, now imagine  you have two parties competing for the loyalty of this electorate. A given voter will stand  somewhere on this line, say here, and that voter, by assumption,  will choose the party which is closest to  his or her point of view. So if you're a voter here and two of the other parties  are here and here, well, you're going to vote for this party here in the center. That leads to competitive  pressures for both parties to move very close to the center and locate themselves at  or near the center, because if you're a party and  you move away from the center, well, you're losing some votes  from at or near the center and the people you're moving closer to on the extreme right or  left sides of the distribution, well, they were gonna vote for you anyway.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z929jakmH8w
The Theory of the Median Voter,"The vote maximizing thing to do  with competition across parties, free and fair competition, is to locate at or near the center. Again, no one is saying this is literally true, there may be real-world forces, which move you a bit away from the center, such as the need to win a party primary  or the need to raise funds from donors. But still in any system where  there's actual real voting, to consistently win  or contend for elections, what you need to do is have points of view, which are not so far away  from most of the voters. What are some possible advantages of having something that operates a bit like the median voter model? Well, for one thing,  you get centrist politics, of course, people who are not at the center don't think that's an advantage.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z929jakmH8w
The Theory of the Median Voter,"Perhaps most importantly, you manage to get rid  of the very worst rulers. Whatever the imperfections  of democracy may be, if there's a truly terrible  ruler or leader, that person can and indeed  probably will be voted out of office. And most generally, you have vigorous competition between the two parties. so they monitor each other,  and they hold each other accountable and they uncover information when  the other party does something wrong. What are the possible disadvantages?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z929jakmH8w
The Theory of the Median Voter,"Well, in a median voter model,  virtually all voters are not decisive, that is, their vote doesn't matter. It's that one voter or very small number of voters right at the center who are deciding who wins. And if most voters are not decisive, how much time, effort, intelligence, information, will they put into learning about politics? Very often not that much. And you have a large number of voters  who adhere to many economic fallacies, or they hold views called ""feel good"" views, just to feel good about themselves, whether or not that view  would be effective in practice.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z929jakmH8w
The Theory of the Median Voter,"And to often an astonishing degree, voters remain uninformed or underinformed in democracy. Those are really some major flaws. Again, we're not saying that  autocracy or dictatorship does better. What we are saying is we need  to have a realistic sense of what democracy can and cannot achieve. Some particular biases of voters have  been studied by our colleague, Bryan Caplan.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z929jakmH8w
The Theory of the Median Voter,"And Caplan, using survey evidence  from the United States, lists a few of these biases. One is what he calls make-work bias, which is just focus on whether jobs are being created and not on whether those jobs  are producing useful output. Another is anti-foreigner bias,  very common in democracies. Pessimism-bias, people think economic conditions are worse or worsening than they really are, and also anti-market bias. When it comes to understanding,  say, the benefits of trade, or the problems with price controls, people don't really understand  as much as professional economists do, and furthermore, they often make  mistakes in an anti-market direction.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z929jakmH8w
The Theory of the Median Voter,"The particular mistakes often depend  upon the country under consideration, but you'll find a lot of biases  like these around the world, and not just in the United States. Two more potential  disadvantages of democracy, at least from some points of view. The first is that voters  far from the center; they often feel unrepresented or uninvolved because it's the center  that's winning all the time. Again, that doesn't have  to be a bad thing, but it's often believed that  a parliament or congress would be better if there could be more  diversity of represented views. So toward that end, a lot of democracies have moved to a form called proportional representation, which is different from winner-takes-all.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z929jakmH8w
The Theory of the Median Voter,"Let's take a look at that. Proportional representation hands out  seats, say in parliament, on the basis of the percentage of the votes won. So to give one very simple formula, imagine if you get 40% of the votes,  you get 40 seats, 30% of the votes, you get 30 seats,  20%, you get 20 seats, 10% of the vote, you get 10 seats. It doesn't have to work  that simply or exactly, it's just an example. Under proportional representation, you then have parties form a coalition to rule.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z929jakmH8w
The Theory of the Median Voter,"So you could imagine  the lead party with 40 and the other party  with 20 teaming up, and they would have 60,  that would be a majority. There will be greater diversity of  opinion expressed in parliament, and you can say that the process  is more representative and some of the people  a bit closer to the extremes will find their views  represented in parliament. But still, the final outcomes  don't have to be either better or necessarily more representative. Because in the case of  this coalition, for instance, you have the party that won 40,  getting its way on most things. And then to create the coalition,  the party that won 20, well, they'll give that party  its way on a few issues, and you still have, you know,  partial rule by the 40% and partial rule by the 20%, that may or may not be better  than the median voter theorem.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z929jakmH8w
The Theory of the Median Voter,"We can say that  proportional representation is a more popular form of  democracy in today's world. But when you look at the key flaws and problems with democracy, namely its informational flaws, proportional representation has  pretty much the same problems as the winner-take-all  median voter systems. This is a big topic and  we've just scratched the surface. Here are some terms  you could google. There are also two very good  classic books you could read, Anthony Downs,  Economic Theory of Democracy, and Bryan Caplan,  The Myth of the Rational Voter.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z929jakmH8w
African Borders and Conflict,"Now let's talk about how  the legacy of colonialism has led to more conflict in Africa  and has lowered living standards. Sub-saharan Africa has had  an above average frequency of conflict since those countries achieved independence. That's been one reason why a lot of them have failed to develop more economically. Wars obviously lower the incentives to invest, they destroy wealth and they make it harder for countries  to implement value-enhancing reforms. But where do those wars come from?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSernx4aFIk
African Borders and Conflict,"Let's consider one important factor. This is what African boundaries  looked like just before colonization. If you're wondering  European colonization of Africa, most of it started in the 1880s and that process was largely complete  by the early 20th century. Anyway, before colonialism, what you see are a lot of very small units. These are not necessarily formal nations  in the modern sense of that term.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSernx4aFIk
African Borders and Conflict,"But they were agreements  or conventions or boundaries which in some way we're respected and they correspond to different ethnic groups. Ok, so now colonialism comes along and it imposes national boundaries on Africa. Of course, at first, these national boundaries are within the colonial structure, but they remain in place after World War II, when the colonial powers start to leave Africa. You can see pretty clearly from this map that the borders imposed by the colonial powers, very often, have only tangential relationships to the distribution of economic groups. There are many nations in Africa, in fact, most nations, which contain a large number of different ethnic groups.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSernx4aFIk
African Borders and Conflict,"Many ethnic groups straddle  two or more nations. And in general, when the national boundaries were set up by the colonial powers, they didn't really care about matching  those boundaries to ethnic groups, because they thought Africa  was simply there's to rule, often for economic motives. And in many cases, they didn't even know about all the different ethnic groups and where their boundaries  might start or finish. So, it was a mix of avarice and bad incentives and mere ignorance, but, in any case, the boundaries  got drawn in fairly arbitrary ways. Again, really not very closely matched up with the distribution of  different ethnic groups.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSernx4aFIk
African Borders and Conflict,"If you'd like some examples of  ethnic groups which are distributed across two or more national boundaries in current Africa, well here's a few of them and, of course, you can google these for more information. It turns out that having the boundaries  drawn in these ways is very bad for peace. So, one empirical result is that civil conflict tends to be concentrated in historical homelands  of partitioned ethnicities. Perhaps most importantly, civil conflict intensity is 50 % higher where partitioned ethnicities reside. That means if you have a region  where ethnicities are split across multiple national borders, the fighting, when there is fighting,  tends to be worse.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSernx4aFIk
African Borders and Conflict,"In those same regions, on average, violence against civilians is 40 % higher and the chance of there being some kind  of control change in government such as a coup d'Ã©tat, well, that is 5 to 10 % higher. And of course, we're talking about changes which occur through fighting and not through elections. All of those results are based on a data set, which is reporting over 43,000 conflict events from the years 1997 to 2010. If you'd like to see African conflict zones in the form of a map, you can study this picture here which is color-coded. If you'd like to study where civil wars have occurred most frequently, you can study this map here which is color-coded, and again, there are in general correlations between these conflicts and regions where  ethnic groups are partitioned across different national borders.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSernx4aFIk
African Borders and Conflict,"The implication is that there  may well have been less conflict had the borders and the ethnicities matched up more closely. This shouldn't actually come  as a major surprise. A lot of the histories of European  violent conflicts for instance had something to do with ethnicities which were partitioned  across national borders. Europe's World War I for instance, had a good deal to do with the fact that national borders and the geographic distribution of different ethnic groups were not closely matched up. This was also a one factor  of many behind Europe's World War II.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSernx4aFIk
African Borders and Conflict,"For instance, there were sizable  German populations in countries other than Germany. And Germany tried to, in some way, take over or incorporate these Germanic populations. But of course, the countries that contained these dramatic populations did not always welcome  the invasions or the incorporations. In any case, this was one of the reasons why European history has  so much conflict in its past. In any case, all of these results  are taken from a very good paper on the history of Africa called ""The Long-Run Effects  of the Scramble for Africa"".",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSernx4aFIk

Is there a Natural Resource Curse?,"Let's consider the idea of a natural resource curse. That's the notion that a country and its citizens may be worse off because that country has more  natural resources. But is that true? Just to take some simple examples, if you look at the nations which have  the richest resources per citizen, those are Australia, Canada,  New Zealand, and Norway. Of course, they're all doing pretty well.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgZTw8lwI-M
Is there a Natural Resource Curse?,"If you look at the two nations which have the poorest resources per citizen, well, those two are Jordan and Malawi. And Jordan is a middle-income country, Malawi is one of  the poorest nations on earth. It's in central Africa, it's landlocked, they still have famines there. So this contrast indicates  the natural resource curse, at least, isn't going to be true  in any very simple way. When you look at the data overall, there are a number of ways  you can show the numbers that would appear to indicate  some kind of natural resource curse.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgZTw8lwI-M
Is there a Natural Resource Curse?,"For instance, in this diagram  on the vertical axis, there is GDP growth, and on the horizontal axis, there is primary exports  as a share of GDP as of 1970, and you can see there is  some negative relationship. That said, it's not a strong  negative relationship. There's an awful lot  of scatter in this graph, and it could be that the notion of  a natural resource curse, overall, is concealing more information than it's revealing. This diagram comes originally from  some work by Sachs and Warner, and you'll find a good discussion of it  in a paper by Manzano and Rigobon. Even if you don't think  there's a natural resource curse, perhaps it's at the very least surprising  that having more natural resources doesn't seem to be good for  a country's rate of economic growth.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgZTw8lwI-M
Is there a Natural Resource Curse?,"So, more generally, what are some  of the economic problems with having natural resources? One is simply that,  in some historical eras, resource prices tend to be falling. This was especially the case for the 30 to 40 years after World War Two. So if resource-rich nations had  a poor growth performance in this period, it could simply have been the price pattern rather than any deeper truth  about having natural resources. Another factor commonly cited  is that, in terms of productivity, resources may be dead-end sectors of a sort.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgZTw8lwI-M
Is there a Natural Resource Curse?,"That is, if you have some  lucrative oil wells in your country, well, you learn how to pump oil, but it doesn't have much spillover  into doing other things well, it doesn't encourage a lot of  your population to become educated. It may just be what is sometimes  called a dead-end sector. Another factor is simply that resource prices are often cyclical and volatile, and they're heavily influenced  by the state of the world economy, and that cyclicality or volatility may stop the resource-wealthy nation from being able to predict and  control its environment and grow around the resource. Resources also may be highly  susceptible to control by elites. It's pretty easy to imagine  a totalitarian state or a dictatorship learning how to pump oil  out of the ground.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgZTw8lwI-M
Is there a Natural Resource Curse?,"It's harder to imagine  those same governments, say, learning how to run Silicon Valley. So that means that if you have a lot of resource wealth, perhaps in the form of oil, that will encourage your government  to be less democratic and less publicly inclusive. Finally, resources may  encourage armed conflict because other countries may  wish to attack yours to take control of the resources. For instance, consider  the diamond wars in Sierra Leone. In that case, it was a civil war.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgZTw8lwI-M
Is there a Natural Resource Curse?,"If we consider Saddam Hussein's  invasion of Kuwait, well, quite possibly  he wouldn't have done it had he not had a chance  of getting a hold of the oil. I'm very much persuaded by the work that shows to the extent  there is a resource curse. For the most part, it appears  to boil down to oil and also nationalized oil sectors. So if we take the countries  which are wealthy in oil, since 1980, they have overall  become less democratic even though the world, as a whole, has become much more democratic over that same time span. The oil-producing countries,  controlling for other factors, also have governments which  are about 50% larger than the non-oil-producing countries.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgZTw8lwI-M
Is there a Natural Resource Curse?,"Having a lot of oil for more countries does seem to bring more corruption  and more centralized control. There's also good evidence  that oil-rich countries, again controlling for other factors, have a much greater amount of gender inequality. For all these reasons, having more oil may indeed be a curse even though, perhaps, there's not a natural resource curse more generally. To the extent there is  a natural resource curse, there are things countries can do  to protect themselves against those problems. For instance, when revenue is high, they should save up and invest those surpluses as Chile has done with its copper revenue.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgZTw8lwI-M
Is there a Natural Resource Curse?,"The price of copper  is indeed quite cyclical, but when the price of copper is low, rather than that meaning  bad times for Chile, they can draw upon their stored revenue. Transparency of revenue  is another good idea basically to limit corruption and  to make sure that the money, which comes in from natural resources, is spent on something useful rather than just being siphoned off by a country's leaders. There are many interesting articles  and books on this topic. A key early piece is  by Jeff Sachs and Andrew Warner. That's called 'Natural Resource Abundance and Economic Growth'.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgZTw8lwI-M
Is there a Natural Resource Curse?,"The Jeffrey Frankel piece listed is an excellent survey of the entire topic. The short Charles Kenny piece,  'What Resource Curse? ' tries to debunk the idea  of a natural resource curse. The work by Michael Ross,  his book, 'The Oil Curse' and his article on political economy  give an excellent sense of how the natural resource curse  may interact with politics. And finally, there's a very good article by Manzano and Rigobon, 'Resource Curse or Debt Overhang'.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgZTw8lwI-M
Wage Gains from Immigration,"The largest gains from immigration  come from the movement of individuals from low-wage countries  to high-wage countries. To make this more concrete, compare the United States to the Caribbean nation of Haiti. Per capita income in Haiti is  a bit over a $1,000 a year. Per capita income in the United States is well over $40,000 a year. So, when Haitians are able  to migrate to the United States, generally, their wages and their incomes rise.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUlnz8pKM6M
Wage Gains from Immigration,"Let's say you take all the Haitians  in either the United States or Haiti and look at those who are earning $10 a day or more. It turns out that 4/5 of that group of Haitians are actually living in the United States. To date, the best way  of curing poverty in Haiti has been to allow Haitians  to move to the United States, Canada, France, and other nations. Or let's look at Mexico  and the United States. Using data from the year 2000, if we take a typical young Mexican male with nine to eleven years of schooling, that individual will earn about  $2.40 an hour in Mexico.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUlnz8pKM6M
Wage Gains from Immigration,"That same individual in the United States will tend to earn $8.70 an hour. If you add that all up across  the course of a year with a full-time job, there is a gain of more than $10,000 when that individual moves  to the United States. Another study tracked particular legal immigrants from Mexico to the United States and it found there was a gain of almost $16,000 a year in terms of higher income after migration. A Guatemalan who moves  to the United States will see his wages go up  by a factor of six fold and for a Kenyan wages on average  go up by a factor of seven fold. Of course, this is not just  about the United States.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUlnz8pKM6M
Wage Gains from Immigration,"In Oceania, many individuals from the island nation of Tonga migrate to New Zealand. There is a visa lottery where  winners are selected randomly. Those individuals who are able to leave  Tonga and migrate to New Zealand end up having wages which are 263% higher simply because they are  living in New Zealand. A study by the World Bank showed that if the 30 wealthiest OECD nations were willing to expand the size  of their labor forces by 3% the gains to the migrants would be  in the order of $300 billion in the form of higher wages. When it comes to anti-poverty recipes, there's really just one  which we know works for sure, and that is immigration  to wealthier countries.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUlnz8pKM6M
Wage Gains from Immigration,"To read more on this topic there's an excellent article by Michael Clemens, ""Economics and Emigration"".

Remittances,"A remittance occurs when an individual working in a foreign country sends money back to the home country. Remittances are an important  source of income for many developing nations. Number one on this list is Tajikistan, where remittances account  for about 35% of GDP. Other nations where remittances  are extremely important include Tonga, Moldova, Nepal, Philippines, Bangladesh, Lebanon, Serbia, Guatemala, Jordan, and El Salvador. For Jordan and El Salvador, remittances are still as much as 16% of GDP.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvZAGhv6eLA
Remittances,"In a typical year for the entire world, remittances will usually  exceed $300 billion. Another nice thing about remittances is that they tend to be fairly stable. Even in downtimes, there's only a slight decrease  in the level of remittances, and remittances are more  stable than foreign investment. The motives for remittances are numerous, but some of the most  common ones are listed here. First, there's altruism: simply caring about the people  back home and wanting them to do better.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvZAGhv6eLA
Remittances,"Another is exchange. You may be sending money back home, but you expect something in return. It might be something quite tangible, like, for instance, a painting or some craftwork, or it might be something quite intangible, such as affection and a lot of phone calls. Insurance is another motive. The people back home may need  to pay expensive doctor bills, or maybe a roof in the house collapsed and they need to somehow  make up for the lost income.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvZAGhv6eLA
Remittances,"There is loan repayment, which is common in developing nations, and also very important is investment. It is often the case that money is sent back home, in particular to villages, to help finance schools or help finance infrastructure or, in some way, make the village or the town a better place. Of course, these motives  and others may all overlap. One interesting feature of remittances is that fairly small sums are sent  if they are sent quite frequently. For instance, the sender might transmit $300 three different times rather than sending $900 all at once.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvZAGhv6eLA
Remittances,"Why is this? The senders are afraid that if they send too much money all of at once, all of it will be spent. There was one study of remittances from El Salvador. The individual sending the money wished that the recipients would save  about 21% of what was sent. The recipients said that they wanted to save only about 2% of what was sent.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvZAGhv6eLA
Remittances,"One way to enforce some savings discipline is simply to send less right now and, in essence, save money  for the people you're sending to. One final point about remittances: The actual gains for the receiving country are not quite as high as the measured numbers  for remittances would suggest. For instance, if a Mexican  is working in the United States and he is earning dollars and what he wants to do  is send money back home using a service such as Western Union, he, in essence, converts  those dollars into Mexican pesos. And in doing so, sending  all that money to Mexico, this raises the value of the peso on foreign exchange markets. What that means is that for some other Mexican companies, it is now harder to export to  the United States because the value of the peso has strengthened.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvZAGhv6eLA
Remittances,"So some of the benefits of the remittances are, in effect, given back in the form of more disadvantageous conditions for exporters. To read more about remittances, there's a very good survey article by Dean Yang called ""Migrant Remittances,"" and also just Google ""economics of remittances"".",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvZAGhv6eLA
Wage Effects in the U.S.,"[Narrator] This is mostly a class about development economics, but there's been so much debate about the effects of immigration on the receiving countries, I thought we'd cover that for just a bit. Sometimes observers have the mistaken intuition that because immigration increases the supply of labor, therefore it must lower wages in the receiving country. Let me first show you what that intuition looks like using supply and demand graphs, and then show you a better way to think about the problem. So here we have the labor market, and the vertical axis is wage, and here's the quantity of labor. And we have a downward sloping demand curve for labor, and we have an upward sloping supply curve.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2Lfeo_aRw
Wage Effects in the U.S.,"And the common intuition is you have more immigration. Well, first, here's the wage, and there's the quantity of labor. But the intuition is you have more immigration, you have a new supply curve, which has shifted out, and you have a new wage level, which is lower than the old wage level, and therefore it seems that by increasing the supply of labor, immigration lowers wages. But that's really not how it works. To think of the question in a  fuller manner, what's going on at the same time is that immigration is increasing the supply of labor, but it's also increasing the demand for labor.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2Lfeo_aRw
Wage Effects in the U.S.,"When immigrants come to the United States, they want to buy a lot of things, and of course, a lot of immigrants start businesses. Such as when Google was started, in part, by an immigrant. So the new market really would look like this. Here is the supply and demand graph, with wage on the vertical axis, quantity of labor here. We have a downward sloping demand curve for labor, we have an upward sloping supply curve.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2Lfeo_aRw
Wage Effects in the U.S.,"It's true the supply curve for labor will shift out, but the demand curve for labor will shift out also. And when you take both shifts into account, well, before, here was the wage level. After both shifts have taken place, we can see that the new wage level, in this case it comes here, it's very slightly higher. But when both curves shift, it's possible that the new wages are higher, the same, or lower, and therefore, as a matter of theory, immigration does not lower wages. That's theory, but what does the data say?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2Lfeo_aRw
Wage Effects in the U.S.,"Economists do not completely agree on this question, so let's look at a few different views. We're going to start with George Borjas. Borjas is an immigrant himself, he is Cuban-American, but Borjas is generally considered to be an immigration skeptic, especially for low-skilled immigration coming to the United States. This table is adapted from his work. Let's just look at a few of the more important results.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2Lfeo_aRw
Wage Effects in the U.S.,"First, for native workers in general, in the long run, what does Borjas estimate to be the net effect of immigration? Actually, it is zero. This doesn't mean there are no losers. In the long run, the group which loses the most are high school dropouts. Their wages are 4.8% lower than  would have been the case with a lower level of immigration.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2Lfeo_aRw
Wage Effects in the U.S.,"The group gaining is high school graduates. Their wages are 1.2% higher, and of course, high school graduates are a fairly numerous group. it makes sense that high school dropouts are the most likely losers, because a lot of the immigration coming to the United States is relatively unskilled, and these unskilled immigrants are competing against American high school dropouts to some extent. Borjas is taking an economy-wide look at what it means to have to compete against more workers of your given type or given skill level. But there are some important benefits of immigration which are not really captured by this approach.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2Lfeo_aRw
Wage Effects in the U.S.,"One of these is comparative advantage. Let's say that you are a doctor. You can get better training or work longer hours if you have the ability to trade with immigrants. For instance, the ability to hire immigrants to clean your home or to watch your children. This helps the doctor, of course, but it also helps all the patients who end up being served by the doctor.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2Lfeo_aRw
Wage Effects in the U.S.,"Immigration also increases returns to capital and returns to land. So the Borjas estimates are really just about wages, but it's generally accepted that capital owners are better off, and it's often been suggested that the United States should allow in more immigrants to boost its currently struggling real estate market. Finally, as I had mentioned in passing before, a lot of immigrants create new jobs, or maybe even new economic sectors altogether. If you look at Silicon Valley, a lot of the new companies there are the result of immigrant entrepreneurship, where the immigrants come from India, China, Russia, and many other places. David Card has studied the wage effects of immigration, and he arrives at results different from those of Borjas.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2Lfeo_aRw
Wage Effects in the U.S.,"What Card does is compare city by city. For instance, the cities which have a lot of immigrants coming to them do not, in general, have lower wage rates for native-born Americans. Cities with fewer immigrants coming to them do not seem to have higher wage rates for native-born Americans. What Card finds is that, on average, immigration doesn't really have much of an impact on wages at all for native-born Americans. You'll note that in the aggregate, this is similar to the conclusion of Borjas, that the net, long-run impact of immigration on wages for workers as a whole is zero.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2Lfeo_aRw
Wage Effects in the U.S.,"Giovanni Peri, working with co-authors, has produced some papers arguing that immigrants may, on net, increase the wages of native-born Americans. Peri makes two good points. First, immigrants often take a lot of jobs where they're not competing against Americans, but those jobs might otherwise end up not being performed at all. Second, Peri compares immigration and offshoring. So the alternative is not always immigration versus an American having a job, but if there were no immigration, it might be the case that American Capital would move overseas and invest overseas, and a native-born American wouldn't have had that job anyway in the first case.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2Lfeo_aRw
Wage Effects in the U.S.,"Peri has argued that by letting in immigrants, you make your country a more important center of economic activity, and this leads to more investment in your country, and less offshoring. And on net, this can be a positive wage effect, or at the very least, it does not have to be a negative wage effect. There are papers on the net wage impact of immigration on countries besides the United States. There are papers on Israel, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, and the United Kingdom. The general results from these papers indicate that the net wage impact of immigrants is either zero or extremely small.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2Lfeo_aRw
Wage Effects in the U.S.,"Nonetheless, immigration tends to be a very controversial topic in the public eye. A lot of the disputes really are about culture. Which individuals should be let into our country, what should our country look like, what should be our country's religions, mores, and social practices. Nonetheless, when it comes to the strictly economic issues, there tends to be a broad consensus among most, but not all economists. And that consensus is that immigration, for the most part, leads to economic benefits and does not have significant negative, downward effects on wages of native-born workers.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2Lfeo_aRw
Wage Effects in the U.S.,"Immigration also tends to benefit innovation and economic growth. To read more on these topics, go to scholar. google.com and you can enter ""George Borjas immigration"" to get to his papers, ""David Card immigration,"" ""Giovanni Peri immigration,"" and a good survey is by Gordon Hanson, ""The Economic Consequences of the  International Migration of Labor"".",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2Lfeo_aRw
Internal Chinese Migration,"Some of the most important  migration issues don't involve crossing a border, but rather they are internal to a country. China has been experiencing what is the largest peacetime movement of labor ever in all of human history. According to the Chinese government, if we look at 1978 to 1999, the urban population in China  grows by about 222 million individuals. Those individuals came  from the countryside, and, of course, most of them moved  to cities in search of higher wages. In the Chinese countryside,  to this very day, often living conditions are  just barely above subsistence.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbggH4KEtBQ
Internal Chinese Migration,"In the cities, there is  some reasonable prospect of attaining a middle-class  standard of living. It depends exactly how you define  the boundaries of a city, but right now, there are  over 160 cities in China which have populations of more than 1 million individuals. This is a fairly recent development, and the remarkable thing is that  this process has occurred fairly smoothly; that is -- 100s of millions of individuals have higher living standards and better lives due  to this internal migration. As you would expect, the migration has generally been away from agricultural areas and toward areas where  there are manufacturing jobs. According to the Economist magazine,  in percentage terms, the Chinese province, which has seen  the most out-migration, is Szechuan province here, in the interior, and the province which has seen  the most in-migrations, again, in percentage terms, is Guangdong province here in the South, which is very strong  in manufacturing and exports.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbggH4KEtBQ
Internal Chinese Migration,"In general, the Chinese population  has been moving toward the East, toward the South, toward growing cities,  and toward the coast. As economic theory would predict, the migrants are more likely  to be young individuals who have more to gain  by uprooting themselves and moving to a new area, and the migrants are more likely to be males than females. After the Chinese Communist revolution, there were very strict controls on migration of Chinese individuals  into the major Chinese cities. Over time, these regulations  have been successively relaxed, but they are still in place. There's a formal permit system, and without a permit, an individual is not supposed to move to a Chinese city.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbggH4KEtBQ
Internal Chinese Migration,"The permits are a controversial policy, but ostensibly they are there  for a few reasons. The first is that current urban  inhabitants don't want to share all of the gains with city life  with everyone from the countryside. Another is that there's fear  of too many migrants stressing urban infrastructure  and leading to excess crowding. Third is the fear that  if everyone moves into the cities, there won't be enough jobs  all at once to employ these individuals. Nonetheless,  many individuals do come, and de facto, they are allowed  to come without permits.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbggH4KEtBQ
Internal Chinese Migration,"This does mean they move to the cities without receiving full government benefits and, perhaps, their children  do not have the typical chance to receive a free education. These individuals are sometimes called  the ""floating population of China"", and this may account for more than  10% of the current Chinese population. The story of internal Chinese migration  continues and it will continue. It's one of the biggest and most important economic stories of our time, and indeed, of all of human history. So far, these migrations have led  to much higher living standards, and they have helped drive Chinese  economic growth because it's the increased labor  that has made possible a much higher of level of production  of goods and services in China.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbggH4KEtBQ
Internal Chinese Migration,"There's not so much  in the way of reliable data on Chinese internal migration, but the broad patterns of  what's going on are pretty clear. For a start, you can google  ""China internal migration"" and also some of the figures and analyses are drawn from this piece, listed here, ""Rural-urban Migration  and Urbanization in China"".",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbggH4KEtBQ
The Malthusian Argument,"One common argument  for economic pessimism stems from the fear  of increasing population. Let's take a look at this argument and see if it's true. The reverend Thomas Robert Malthus  published his famous book, ""An Essay on the Principle of Population,"" first edition 1798. This book remains  extremely influential today. In the basic argument, Malthus suggests that there are diminishing returns to land.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxXmz0Aisms
The Malthusian Argument,"That is, if we add more workers to the land the land produces smaller and smaller amounts of additional value. This means, for instance,  that if population doubles and we imagine twice the number of people working on the land, we don't produce twice as much food. So a doubling of the population would mean that each person actually  has less food than before compared to the lower population. Now imagine that a technological  improvement comes along and people are somewhat wealthier. In this situation there will be,  according to Malthus, a greater number of people.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxXmz0Aisms
The Malthusian Argument,"People will live longer and they also will have more resources to support a greater number of children. Fewer children, for instance, will die in infancy. That means a growing population. But if you accept Malthus's assumption  of diminishing returns to land and the notion of a fixed supply of land, not all is well. The growing population means  less food for each person.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxXmz0Aisms
The Malthusian Argument,"Over time, the population will shrink again because there will be  less food to support children, less food to support  people in their old age, and living standards will eventually fall. The basic point is that, at first, something good happens then population goes up  because of the good news but in the longer run that new and larger population brings you back down to a lower standard of living. Those are the basic mechanics of the Malthusian model. Just to review those  assumptions written down, there's a fixed and vital factor  of production, land, there are diminishing  returns on that factor. Income determines population growth, rising wages mean higher survival rates, but higher survival rates eventually push wages back down.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxXmz0Aisms
The Malthusian Argument,"In the Malthusian model, a lot of policies which might appear to help the poor actually don't help at all. For instance, imagine a vaccination program which limits some kind of disease. In the short run, of course, this will make the poor people healthier. But in the Malthusian model, in the longer run, you end up with a greater  number of poor people because fewer of them are dying and living standards collapse once again. This seems counterintuitive and indeed, as we'll see, it's probably false, but nonetheless this anecdote  is one way of thinking through what the Malthusian model  would actually mean in practice.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxXmz0Aisms
The Malthusian Argument,"There is some evidence that a version of the Malthusian model may help us explain earlier  periods in world history. For instance, if we take a typical European living standard during the time of the Roman Empire and compare it to a typical  European living standard in, say, the year 1700, it's not clear that  there was much progress, if indeed any progress at all. Net sustainable economic growth was slow during virtually all of this period and many regions of the world retrogressed. We don't have the data to say for sure that Malthus was right about this period, but, at the very least, the sense we have from the data we do have is consistent with a Malthusian model. Since the industrial revolutions  of the 19th century, the Malthusian model seems  to be mostly or even completely false.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxXmz0Aisms
The Malthusian Argument,"For instance, take the country of japan, it really does have a fixed supply of land. Improvements in technology have kept  the Japanese standard of living very high, well above subsistence, and rather than just  multiplying numbers endlessly, in fact the birth rate in japan has fallen dramatically. The population of japan  actually is shrinking and living standards remain high even though, at the moment,  the rate of economic growth is fairly low. It's interesting, but in 1800 Malthus himself wrote about China and Japan. And he wrote, I quote : ""From the accounts we have in China and Japan, it may be fairly doubted whether the best directed efforts of human industry could double the produce of these countries even once in any number of years"".",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxXmz0Aisms
The Malthusian Argument,"Of course, what we saw in the late 20th century is that the economic produce of Japan could double in about 10 years time and the economic produce of China  could double in about 7 years time and stay there. On these issues Malthus  was quite simply wrong. What about Africa? Might the Malthusian model  be true for Africa today? Development economist Charles Kenny  set out to study exactly this question and he looked at data from  46 different African countries.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxXmz0Aisms
The Malthusian Argument,"Keep in mind the Malthusian predictions. The first is that rising GDP per capita should lead to a rising population. The second is that a rising population  should lead to falling GDP per capita. But of the 46 African  countries Kenny looked at, those Malthusian correlations  were found in only 13 of them and only in 4 of those 13 cases were the correlations even marginally strong, defined by Kenny as greater than 0.3. That suggests that, for the most part, even for Africa, the Malthusian model today is false.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxXmz0Aisms
The Malthusian Argument,"The Malthusian model is perhaps  best thought of as a kind of challenge which the world must must face. But not is a good description of how the world actually works, at least not today. For further readings on this topic,  you can google ""Thomas Robert Malthus"". You can even read Malthus's essay online if you want. And for the more modern take, using data, please google  ""Charles Kenny Malthusian trap"".",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxXmz0Aisms
The African Demographic Dividend,"If there's anywhere in the world where the demographic dividend is going to prove important,  its sub-Saharan Africa. Between 2012 and 2050, the population of sub-Saharan Africa  is roughly expected to double. On a yearly basis, if you consider  individuals between the ages of 15 and 64, their numbers are expected to go up on a yearly basis, on average by 3.5%. The dependency ratio can be  expected to make a very large shift. So, as of 2012, there are roughly six people working  for five people not working in sub-Saharan Africa.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBIbwNevWhk
The African Demographic Dividend,"By the time 2050 comes around, we can expect that ratio  to be almost 2 to 1, that is, two people working  for every one person not working. The good news, of course, is that  a lot more young people means a lot more people working. This makes it easier to increase output and this kind of so-called  demographic dividend has driven economic booms in parts of the world as diverse as East Asia and also Ireland. Having a large number of  working people also makes it easier to support the very old and  to support the very young. The obvious question, of course, is: What will all of these people do for jobs?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBIbwNevWhk
The African Demographic Dividend,"For an optimistic perspective on this matter, consider the work of Alwyn Young. Alwyn Young went back and looked at the numbers on Africa, and he decided that other economists  have been underestimating the rate of African growth. A typical estimate is that  the continent of Africa has been growing at about 1% a year, and, indeed, those are the numbers  shown by national income statistics. Alwyn Young looks instead  at numbers on consumption, how people are spending their money. He looks at ownership of durables,  housing conditions, children's nutrition and health,  and household time and family economics.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBIbwNevWhk
The African Demographic Dividend,"His conclusion is that, on average,  sub-Saharan Africa has been growing at a rate of about 3.3%. Of course, that's much better news. In this view, much of sub-Saharan Africa has a rising middle class, rising service sectors,  and rising cities and urbanization, and that all of these developments, taken together, will in fact put most of these young people to work and in a very productive manner. Africa can expect a kind of  demographic dividend to help spur its growth. Again, that's the optimistic perspective.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBIbwNevWhk
The African Demographic Dividend,"For a more pessimistic perspective,  consider the work of Peter Lipton. Here is what lipton wrote: ""Stop kidding ourselves. Faster GDP growth in Africa, since 2000, is mainly a mining boom  with dubious benefits. Staples yields and labor productivity  have not reversed the dismal trends that Peter Timmer diagnosed  two decades ago. Big credible rises are seen in only  a few African countries, for instance, Rwanda, Ghana.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBIbwNevWhk
The African Demographic Dividend,"The populous ones, Ethiopia,  Nigeria, maybe Kenya, above all, DR Congo  tell a sad tale"". In Lipton's view, what many people are calling a demographic dividend in fact has the potential to  be a demographic disaster. There will be many more young people but not necessarily very productive ways of employing them. This remains very much an open debate and, of course, the right answer may depend upon exactly which countries you're looking at. For more reading on these and related issues, see the references given here.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBIbwNevWhk
Environmental Economics,"-- This video will give just a very brief overview of some key issues in environmental economics. Probably the best way to study environmental economics is to focus on some very specific issues and to learn those issues very well, including some of the science. In this overall course,  we'll be covering some of these issues, especially under the sections of water and food supply. But for now, let's just consider some  broad topics that tend to re-emerge in a lot of different issues of  environmental economics. One thing that is clear is that there is still a lot of major economic problems in the world.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pg99Ix12rds
Environmental Economics,"According to estimates, 1.3 million people lack electricity. 800 million people lack an all-weather  road and adequate nutrition is far from universal. So there are many problems which require  solutions. Those solutions will involve economic growth, and that economic growth  will in some ways bring more pressure on the environment. Still the human problems are still considered truly pressing.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pg99Ix12rds
Environmental Economics,"One common attitude can be summed up by the saying: ""First get wealthy, then go green,"" and arguably the western economies have done something like this. They grew very rapidly in the 19th century and much of the 20th century. They polluted quite a bit. At the time they didn't worry about that pollution. Once they became wealthier in the era after World War 2, then finally they started some measure of environmental cleanup.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pg99Ix12rds
Environmental Economics,"For the most part, China and a lot of  other developing nations are following a similar path. That is, they are focusing on becoming wealthy first, then they'll worry about a lot of their environmental  problems later. I'm not sure this is exactly the right attitude, but there is something to be said for it. That is, there are pressing human needs, a lot of people in poverty, and growth will improve those people's lives. It's also striking to see that a large  number of environmental problems will improve with economic growth itself, but not all.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pg99Ix12rds
Environmental Economics,"Let's look at this more closely: As  economic growth proceeds, a lot of the air pollution problems become less serious. So consider this picture, which looks at  what are called local and visible pollutants. What we find in this picture is that as nations become wealthier, on average, their local and visible pollutants are decreasing. You can think of the poor countries as needing to burn a lot of dirtier fuels, or having more indoor air pollution, or  in general just not having the resources to improve or clean up their air. There's also plenty of evidence that wealthier nations have cleaner water supplies.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pg99Ix12rds
Environmental Economics,"Yet, two points should be made here: the first is that not all pollution problems improve with economic growth. For instance if we look at this picture,  which considers CO2 emissions. In general CO2 emissions go up as a country is becoming wealthier, because more wealth involves greater economic output, and that involves greater burning of fossil fuels, and then also higher CO2 emissions. The other point that should be made is even those pollution problems which improve  with economic growth, they don't necessarily improve automatically. They improve often because the economy under question is doing something specific to  worry about or take care of those pollution problems.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pg99Ix12rds
Environmental Economics,"It's also becoming more widely recognized  that pollution itself may damage economic growth. A recent World Bank study looked at Ghana, Tajikistan and China and it found, in those countries, environmental problems may cost 9% of GDP a year or possibly more. For the countries surveyed, the  average cost was about 8% of GDP. Below you see a picture of Shanghai, this is air pollution in Shanghai, and in general, in Chinese cities, the air pollution is a very serious problem as it is in many Indian cities. One example of the economic cost of this air pollution is that it makes people less productive.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pg99Ix12rds
Environmental Economics,"It leads to them having greater health ailments, and overall this lowers economic output. There's also greater sense these days, that resource damage can be costly to reverse, or in some extreme cases,  perhaps impossible to reverse. So the attitude of grow now, go green later, again, may not exactly be correct. There may be some areas where you would prefer to address the environmental problems in advance because it would be,  in the longer run, cheaper to do so. Still, there are a lot concrete problems when nations try to address their environmental problems in advance.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pg99Ix12rds
Environmental Economics,"One problem is that very often in parts of those economies, there are weak or poorly defined property rights. There also tend to be quite weak regulatory structures, just as many other institutions of governance may be weak. And there is also at many times a high degree or relatively high degree of  corruption. All of those factors make it much harder for developing countries to address their pollution problems. One thing that is striking, is how much  the world as a whole is, in some critical regards, is actually subsidizing pollution rather than trying to prevent it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pg99Ix12rds
Environmental Economics,"So if we look at estimates, we find for instance, that right now there are subsidies for fossil fuels at almost half a trillion, worldwide, there are subsidies for water use very often excessive water use, running $2-300 billion worldwide. There are subsidies for fisheries running in the neighborhood of $10-30 billion, and that usually involves an overuse of those fisheries, and an inefficient rate of running down fish stocks, and there are $370 billion of subsidies for agriculture, and those often end up being subsidies indirectly to environmental degradation. Now this is for the world as the whole,  not just for developing countries, but in general, when you look at the  policies of developing countries, we find they, often in extreme form, follow the same paths, of subsidizing polluting fossil fuels, especially dirty coal,  subsidizing excess water use, sometimes excess subsidy to fisheries, and lots of subsidies to agriculture. So we can see here, how difficult it can  be to address pollution problems. It's not just a matter of getting  pollution under control, in some useful or efficient way, but rather, reversing a set of policies that, in some regards, unknit or, right now, subsidizing  pollution.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pg99Ix12rds
Environmental Economics,"I would, again, stress the point that to learn environmental economics as it relates to development, you should focus your attention on very specific areas. And again, we'll cover some of those areas in this course, but by no means is it possible to cover all of them. But if you would like one very general, good introduction to environmental economics and development in general, you could start with an online World Bank report  called ""Inclusive Green Growth"".",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pg99Ix12rds
Skyscrapers and Slums: What's Driving Mumbai's Housing Crisis?,"âª [music] âª - [Alex] Welcome to Mumbai! With a population  of 22 million people, it's India's largest city and one of the most  populous cities in the world. And it doesn't have a lot of land because it's built on a peninsula. That also makes Mumbai one of the most densely  populated cities in the world. Unlike other cities with a lot of people and not a lot of land -- cities like Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Manhattan -- Mumbai is not a skyscraper city.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWg2bgJPakM
Skyscrapers and Slums: What's Driving Mumbai's Housing Crisis?,"Now there are tall buildings, but the average height is low, and that's surprising because the price of land in Mumbai is high. And when the price of land is high, developers have an incentive to economize on land. That's why around the world, the trend we see is the higher the price of land, the higher the heights of buildings. So why aren't there more  tall buildings in Mumbai? And what are the consequences?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWg2bgJPakM
Skyscrapers and Slums: What's Driving Mumbai's Housing Crisis?,"Those are the economic questions and the puzzles  we'll be looking at today. To help us answer these questions, I spoke with Reuben Abraham and Kshitij Batra  from the IDFC Institute -- a think tank based in Mumbai that works on issues of urban infrastructure  and governance. - [Kshitij] Mumbai and, in fact,  a lot of Indian cities have some of the most restrictive  land-use constraints in the world. The main tool in Bombay that is used is the floor space index, which basically limits  how much you can build on top of the land that you own, and so it restricts the construction to about 1.3 FSI in most of Bombay. - [Alex] Let's pause here  for a second to talk FSI.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWg2bgJPakM
Skyscrapers and Slums: What's Driving Mumbai's Housing Crisis?,"Cities around the world  use a floor space index or ratio to regulate the maximum amount of floor space that can be built on a given plot of land. For example,  a floor space index of 1 lets builders build 1 square meter of floor space for every square meter of plot. The builders get to decide  whether that means covering the entire plot  with say a one-story building, half the plot  with a two-story building or one-quarter of the plot with a four-story building, and so on. So the higher the FSI,  the more space that can be built on the same plot of land. When we compare Mumbai's FSI of 1.3 to other densely populated cities, the differences are striking.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWg2bgJPakM
Skyscrapers and Slums: What's Driving Mumbai's Housing Crisis?,"The FSI in Singapore can be as high as 25. New York, Chicago, and Hong Kong allow FSI's up to 12 or 15. In fact, Mumbai  and other Indian cities -- they have some of the most  restrictive FSI's in the world. The higher allowable FSI in cities like New York has enabled more offices and apartments to be built on the same land. Instead of sprawling outwards, Manhattan has grown up.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWg2bgJPakM
Skyscrapers and Slums: What's Driving Mumbai's Housing Crisis?,"In fact, by letting buildings grow tall, Manhattan has increased its size by almost two additional Manhattans -- an amazing way of making more land essentially out of thin air. - So the government  is artificially trying to restrict how much builders can construct  on the land that is available by using this tool. It's very regressive and it doesn't make sense, and it actually drives up  the cost of housing, of commercial real estate, and the cost of living in Bombay. The average of floor space per person is about 48 square feet per person, and just as a comparison, the U.S. Federal Government  mandates that you have to have a minimum of 50 square feet  per person in prison cells. - Wow.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWg2bgJPakM
Skyscrapers and Slums: What's Driving Mumbai's Housing Crisis?,"- And so people are living in more densely populated conditions in Bombay then they are in the prison system in the U.S. Now that this policy  has been in place for the last several decades, and the demand is high and has only been increasing, you created basically  rent-seeking opportunities for the political system,  for the bureaucratic system, to extract rents -- no pun intended -- for being able  to sell off additional FSI. [horns honking] - [Alex] So we have a lot of people, not a lot of space. One thing you do see  is a lot of slums. It's hard to ignore them  when you're in Mumbai. How is this related to low FSI?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWg2bgJPakM
Skyscrapers and Slums: What's Driving Mumbai's Housing Crisis?,"- [Reuben] You have  the Island City with 1.3 FSI, and you've got  the suburbs with 1 FSI in probably the densest urban conurbation in the world. So obviously you're going to get  some pretty bad outcomes of consequence  which primarily consist of driving the poor out  of any kind of formal housing. So, in fact, if you go in there, what you basically see is by and large,  especially in the Island City is mostly I would say  lower-middle-income people to middle-income people  who live in slums, and that's because they've been priced out of the housing market. - Because of the low FSI? - That's right.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWg2bgJPakM
Skyscrapers and Slums: What's Driving Mumbai's Housing Crisis?,"The government has now  clearly made housing one their key priorities, but that housing is nowhere near the place of employment. So it actually makes it  extraordinarily cumbersome for people to commute to work where the slums are actually where work is, as a consequence of which people would rather live in slums rather then move into formal housing that the government  actually provided for you. - Right. So the government sometimes builds housing which is so far away from work that people would prefer to live in the slums. - Yes.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWg2bgJPakM
Skyscrapers and Slums: What's Driving Mumbai's Housing Crisis?,"I mean one way to solve  for their problem was to have much more effective  public transport. - Yeah. And in many parts  of the world, in order to take advantage of public transportation, you build tall, near a metro station. - That's right. - Right?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWg2bgJPakM
Skyscrapers and Slums: What's Driving Mumbai's Housing Crisis?,"But that's not happening so much? - Well, the conversation is beginning to happen. So transit-oriented development is actually part of the conversation. So if you look  at the Mumbai development plan that was tabled last year, you will see that the FSI along transit corridors  is very high. If I remember right,  it's closer to 8 near the transit corridor.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWg2bgJPakM
Skyscrapers and Slums: What's Driving Mumbai's Housing Crisis?,So that conversation is beginning. But part of the problem is a lot of planners can't seem  to tell the difference between density  of physical space and people -- it's something that people don't necessarily understand. Let's assume for a second that we double the FSI  of Bombay from 1.3 to 2.6. Now the fears that people have that's going to lead to overwhelming density actually requires the population of Bombay to also double. Now that is not going to happen.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWg2bgJPakM
Skyscrapers and Slums: What's Driving Mumbai's Housing Crisis?,"So, what you're really going to see is you're going to make  more space available per capita. People need to get over  this conflation problem between density of people, density of space. Because right now when you say you can give high FSI  near transit corridors, what's going on through  people's mind is, ""Oh my goodness. Things are so crowded here already. Things are going  to get ten times worse if I give increased FSI"".",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWg2bgJPakM
Skyscrapers and Slums: What's Driving Mumbai's Housing Crisis?,"They need to understand the fact  that what you're really providing is additional space, not additional people. - Right.

Rent Control in Mumbai,"âª [music] âª [Alex] Rent controls are popular with renters all over the world because they appear to offer lower prices with few adverse consequences. In the long run, however, extensive rent controls can cause entire cities to crumble. You can see that today in Mumbai, India. All of the predicted  consequences of rent control can be seen in Mumbai. There is a shortage of rental housing.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fh4tPWYeks
Rent Control in Mumbai,"Very, very little new rental housing is being constructed, and the stock of old rental housing  is crumbling and falling apart. At rents of 500 to 600 rupees a month, maybe $10 a month, the landlords can't even afford to pay the taxes, let alone pay the maintenance and the upkeep. Rent controls began in Mumbai in 1949 when rents were frozen at 1940 levels. And, amazingly, rents have barely increased since that time despite tremendous inflation and increased urbanization. To learn more,  I spoke with Vaidehi Tandel, Reuben Abraham and Kshitij Batra from the IDFC Institute -- a think tank in Mumbai that works on issues  of urban infrastructure.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fh4tPWYeks
Rent Control in Mumbai,[Alex] They froze rents at 1940 levels? [Kshitij] They did. We hear of these stories  where families are paying a few hundred rupees a month for a flat that would otherwise cost maybe a lakh of rupees a month. You're going to have to tell us what a lakh is. I'm sorry.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fh4tPWYeks
Rent Control in Mumbai,"So that would  be about 100,000 rupees. Wow! So, they're paying  100 or 200, 300 rupees a month for something which is worth 100,000? Yeah. In this case, you have actually a lot of families that are perfectly well-to-do.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fh4tPWYeks
Rent Control in Mumbai,"But they've just been grandfathered  into these rent-controlled flats and they've been living  there for that time. These are massive properties. Some of these are massive, massive apartments. In India, tenant rights are very, very strong, and the court system is very, very slow. The owner of this building -- which has long been  under rent control -- has long tried to evict the tenants.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fh4tPWYeks
Rent Control in Mumbai,"In fact, the owner of this building  has been involved in a lawsuit that was started  by his grandfather 50 years ago. There's a remarkable sign  from the owners. Take a look. ""Portions of the said building are in ruinous condition, likely to fall, and dangerous to any person occupying or passing by the same"". It's falling apart.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fh4tPWYeks
Rent Control in Mumbai,"It's beginning to crumble. Now, in part, that's a threat  to try and get the tenants to leave. But it's an all-too-believable threat. [News presenter] Another deadly building collapsed in India. A five-story apartment building fell in Mumbai early Friday morning while people were fast asleep.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fh4tPWYeks
Rent Control in Mumbai,"It's unknown exactly how many people are still underneath the rubble. Rescuers have been digging  for survivors all day long. [Vaidehi] There's really no incentives for them to maintain the existing stock and you see really bad deterioration of the buildings that are under rent controls. So, the government then had to go and create an assessed buildings policy which sort of looks after these buildings and pays for their maintenance. Assess as a special tax?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fh4tPWYeks
Rent Control in Mumbai,"Yes, for repairing and maintaining  these very, very dilapidated and at-risk rent control buildings. So, does the government actually use the proceeds of the tax to fix the buildings? I'm not sure, actually. [Alex] There's another problem with rent controls in Mumbai. Rent controls encourage landlords to leave their properties vacant rather than renting them out and risking the possibility of having a tenant that they can't evict for the next half-century.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fh4tPWYeks
Rent Control in Mumbai,"It's no surprise that 15% of the housing stock  in Mumbai lies vacant. [Kshitij] I think the census in 2011 -- that's a government survey -- found that around 11 million properties were lying vacant across urban India, which is a huge number, given that they themselves estimated that the housing shortfall is 18 million. [Alex] It's clear  that abolishing rent controls would solve many of these problems. But are there other ways to get more affordable housing on the market? Can the government build  more homes for the poor?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fh4tPWYeks
Rent Control in Mumbai,"[Reuben] I've been working  on this particular issue for at least nine years now, and I have moved from calling it ""affordable housing"" to calling it ""making housing affordable"". Any housing that comes  into the market will be captured by the rich or whoever have the means to capture it. So, therefore, I would argue that the real focus now should be on just increasing  the supply of housing. Because if you don't increase the supply of housing, the rich will just keep capturing it. So, you will see numerous instances just in Mumbai itself of you look at an urban plan, and you see these plans for affordable housing, where four 1-bedroom apartments have effectively become  one 4-bedroom apartment.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fh4tPWYeks
Rent Control in Mumbai,"So, you've literally grabbed from the poor and made hot condos for the rich. Anytime you have two prices  on the market, the low price will sell to the high price, or there will be some market operator that will find a way to grab the lower price because there's a higher price that's actually available on the market. In effect, the slums look like poverty, when in fact it's actually a real estate problem because the cost of housing is just exorbitant at the sort of income levels that you have in a city like Mumbai. So, the slums are really  the only free market housing. That's right, free-market housing and funnily enough, also the only form  of rental housing that's available.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fh4tPWYeks
Rent Control in Mumbai,"Once you put in place a policy like that, you do not have an organized opposition to it. If you try to increase those rents, you'd have politically a backlash. So, people would say rent's already so high in Mumbai, why would you allow increase in rent controls? It's a policy that affects  not just people who are living here but people who can't live here. People who don't live here but who want to move here.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fh4tPWYeks
Rent Control in Mumbai,"Right, right. So, they don't have  a political base from which to act. Absolutely. That's absolutely right. Wow.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fh4tPWYeks
Rent Control in Mumbai,"[Alex] Rent controls are not the only problem. The approval process to build new housing in Mumbai is lengthy. In part, because builders are subject to numerous requirements, not just to do with safety issues but also on building heights, room sizes, and even parking requirements for apartments built for people  who typically don't own cars. The single biggest problem would be approvals. The approval process -- it's longer here than in Europe or the United States?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fh4tPWYeks
Rent Control in Mumbai,"Far longer. Today, cost of capital in India is close to 15% if not more. At 15%, if my approvals process takes 24 months, don't be surprised that I will  only be able to build condos. I will not be able to build anything cheaper than that because it's just pure mathematics. That's just how it works.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fh4tPWYeks
Rent Control in Mumbai,"As long as the cost of capital remains that high and the approvals process is this long, you will end up with condos. Companies that began  with the explicit aim of building affordable housing -- raised a humungous amount of private equity planning to build 700,000 rupee homes -- are today building 5 million rupee homes because that's what the entire process of approvals does to them. That's the effective consequence of all these regulations which were really put in place in a well-meaning fashion, but have obviously -- you know the old line about the path to hell being paved with good intentions. This is a great example of that. [Narrator] You're on your way to mastering economics.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fh4tPWYeks

East India Company,now let's talk about the east india company which played a critical role in the period of colonial rule over india the east india company was first chartered by queen elizabeth of england in the year 1600 it was to trade with asia it was to explore it had monopoly powers due to its legal charter and eventually it played a significant role in ruling over india the key year here is 1757 and that year there was a famous battle called the battle of plassi the british had already had trade and military involvement in parts of east india and bengal and this was a kind of decisive battle that showed that to some extent british rule was here to stay the bengalis were defeated by the man portrayed by this statue his name was robert clive he is also known as clive of india this is considered a decisive battle in establishing british rule the british government didn't have the resources itself to rule over india handily so they delegated a lot of this task to the east india company this was really quite a striking state of affairs here you had a private company accountable to its shareholders and motivated primarily by profit ruling over part of a colonial empire the company had an especially strong presence along the eastern coast of india especially the northern part of the east including calcutta and the state of bengal the company's authority eventually extended up through parts of the north some parts of the west coast and some other small parts of historic india the company left alone or had a significantly weaker role in many parts of the indian interior in the early years of the company it was primarily a trading monopoly for england's trade with the east in the case of india the company handled mainly rice textiles horses and silver economist adam smith pictured here was a strong critic of the company smith favored free trade and he generally opposed grants of monopoly privilege to individual businesses still the role of the company changed and evolved over time with the passage of the years the company became more involved in governing and in particular revenue extraction a key year here in the history of the company in india is 1765 that is the year when the company obtained revenue rights in the area of bengal and from that point on the company was extracting revenue from india through the medium of taxation the taxes on land were often quite high typically over 50 percent under mughal rule the taxes were more frequently in the range of 40 to 50 percent collecting and enforcing the taxes wasn't easy of course the company relied on cooperation from local rulers but there was frequently a tug of war and very often the company would have to threaten to cut off access to the ocean if the rulers didn't pass along the share of the money to the company frequently the company found itself getting involved quite directly in internal conflicts within india and this had to do with getting its share of the money out it goes without saying that over the same period of time the company was not investing very much in india in the form of public goods this gets back to the fundamental conflict between the incentives of a ruling private company which is to extract revenue and what is good for india the two turned out to be very different things in 1770 there was a famous famine in bengal and many many people died the company did very little to stop this but the company at this time did do one thing it raised taxes around this time the british government starts looking into the affairs of the company more closely and this begins a slow erosion of the powers of the company as the government becomes more involved still the government wasn't much of a check of the powers on the of the company in india imagine the company in london being represented by some wealthy shareholders and having a lot of political influence the company had a very strong influence over parliament then the company really did do a very effective job of extracting more tax revenue from india if we look for instance at the data on rupees per square mile how much tax revenue was extracted well in the year 1763 not long after the company had a more formal role in governance the figure was 236 by 1817 it's 520 and by 1853 it's 724.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgeYJ9F4zTE
Land taxation in early India,"High taxation on land was one factor which very much slowed down  India's economic development. Even today, agriculture is a significant part of the Indian economy employing about half of  the Indian workforce. But in earlier centuries, agriculture really was most of the economy. Under Mughal rule,  before the arrival of the British, taxes on land were commonly between 40 to 50%. This was already fairly high.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94FTRmsu7_Q
Land taxation in early India,"To put those numbers in context, at the time, taxes on land in china were quite commonly under 10%. When the British East India Company started to take over in rural parts of India in the 18th century, what they did was to raise taxes  to maximize revenue, backed by coercion and violence. The company used Indian intermediaries to collect the tax revenue. Taxes went up in general to  the range of 50 to 60%, and, in some cases,  they were as high as 80%. In general, higher taxes lead  to lower effort in working the land and less interest in bringing about agricultural improvements.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94FTRmsu7_Q
Land taxation in early India,"One striking lesson from studying the history of developing economies is that very bad policies can have  long and persistent effects, sometimes stretching centuries. If we look at India, we can  compare different regions. Those which had landlord-based systems with high rates of taxation and  extreme land inequality, and those areas that had what are called individual cultivator systems. The difference to this day remains. The regions which had  the landlord-based systems have fewer primary schools, fewer high schools, fewer roads, they are less likely to have electricity, and they have lower rates  of electoral participation.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94FTRmsu7_Q
Land taxation in early India,"The good news is modern India. Most of India abolished these forms  of land taxation in the early 1950s following their liberation  from British colonial rule. Unfortunately, some of  the legacies still remain. To read more on this topic,  here are two very good sources.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94FTRmsu7_Q
Railroads and colonial India,"During the last 100 years of colonial India, railways were the most important investment in infrastructure. Let's take a look at what we know. Before the building of the railway network, transportation in India was extremely slow and often impossible alltogether. There were very few roads, and the roads that were there were often inaccessible due to the rainfall. There was water transportation along the coast and through a few major river systems.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THfbLcLJrRU
Railroads and colonial India,"Nonetheless, the markets for most goods were typically small and regional. Only a few goods with relatively high values and which were relatively easy to transport, such as print and cotton textiles, could be sent to national and international markets using the Indian transportation network. The peak of railway building in India came during the years 1850 through 1870, and indeed this was a significant endeavor, as you can see on this map. In South India, in the second half of the 19th century, there were 10 million jobs created simply from building the railroads. By the early 1900s, the fourth largest rail network in the entire world was to be found in India.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THfbLcLJrRU
Railroads and colonial India,"All of the sudden, much of India was now interconnected. The coming of the railways made a really big difference for trade in many commodities. For instance, the expense of getting salt fell by about 87%, mostly because it was much easier to transport salt using railways than using Indian roads. Or we can compare the year 1860 to the year 1900. Between these two years, price dispersion in India decreased a considerable amount.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THfbLcLJrRU
Railroads and colonial India,"That meant in different regions or in different states, the prices of agricultural crops were now much closer to each other, because if the price of one region was higher than the price in another region, it would make sense to buy the crop in the lower-priced region and ship it to the region where the crop had a higher price. So between 1860 and 1900, price dispersion for crops went down by about 60%. And of that 60%, about 20% of that, or one-third, was due to the effect of the railways. If we take the period from 1870 to 1913, it's been estimated over those years, railroads accounted for about 20% of India's economic growth. Government in India had a big influence on the railways from the beginning.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THfbLcLJrRU
Railroads and colonial India,"But at first, the railways were mostly a private endeavor. However, the government guaranteed railway investors a 5% rate of return. This, of course, urged investment in the railway network, because, in essence, the investors could only make money, and they could not lose money. That's one reason why the Indian railway network was in fact built so quickly. Nonetheless, nationalization came.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THfbLcLJrRU
Railroads and colonial India,"Partial nationalization started in about 1880 as the government of India took over a majority ownership stake in the former railway companies. Complete nationalization of the rail network took place between 1924 and 1927 as the colonial government completely took over the railways and the railway network. Interestingly, following nationalization, it seems that costs fell for the operation of the railway network. This is perhaps counterintuitive, because very often private companies are more efficient than governments. But think about that initial incentive of a 5% guaranteed rate of return.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THfbLcLJrRU
Railroads and colonial India,"It also means that a private company can invest as much as it wants, and not have to worry very much about costs, and still get that 5% rate of return. Obviously what happened is that the private investors did not worry much about costs, and the nationalized railway system was in some regards more efficient. To read more on these topics, you can Google to some excellent pieces by Dan Bogart and Latika Chaudhary on the Indian railways. And there are also some books by Ian Kerr, including Engines of Change.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THfbLcLJrRU
Gandhi and the Salt March,"[Narrator] Gandhi's 1930's Salt March is one of the famous episodes in Indian history. Let's look at it for a bit from an  economic point of view. The Salt March was a protest march  against the British monopoly on salt, and also the British taxation of salt. It lasted for 23 days, which,  of course, is a long time to march, and it ran for 390 kilometres, again, a long way, running, at the end, along the western coast of India, somewhat around here. Or to see that in the red, imagine it running something like this.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLY1COIu9fg
Gandhi and the Salt March,"Gandhi was the leader of the march. He applied his principles of non-violent resistance, and he ended being thrown in jail. Nehru was also involved in the protest, and he too ended up being thrown in jail. Salt, of course, is a very important  commodity, essential for human life. Salt had been taxed in India  for a long time, but under the Mughal Empire, salt taxes were relatively low.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLY1COIu9fg
Gandhi and the Salt March,"Taxes became much higher when the British East India Company had a role in India, and the British salt tax really gets going in 1765, when Robert Clive, also known as Clive of India, instituted a system of salt monopolies and salt taxation. At first this tax was at 35%, and then it went up to 50%. It's not surprising to suppose that the cheapest way of getting salt in India was to have the salt produced in India itself, but British policy was not steered toward that end. There was, in fact, a place in England where salt was produced, there was a salt lobby from near and around Cheshire, England, and overtime, the salt producers  from Cheshire, England acquired a very strong market foothold in India, supported by these monopoly privileges and by these taxes. Of course, this was a very bad deal for Indians, who had to buy salt.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLY1COIu9fg
Gandhi and the Salt March,"Indians broke these laws to some extent, but overall, salt production moved  away from India and toward England. The English salt producers were earning monopoly profits. This really was a classic case of special interest groups, strangling one sector of an economy with monopoly and taxes. The British kept on trying to keep control, so they built an entire salt line, which ran across much if India, and on that salt line, they employed nearly 12,000 men to try to stop Indian salt from sneaking through. As you would expect with  this monopoly and high tax, there was a lot of smuggling, and also a lot of salt adulteration.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLY1COIu9fg
Gandhi and the Salt March,"There was a new salt tax passed in 1882, the purpose there was to try to restrict the distribution and handling of salt to government depots, but, of course, that was not, in every way, effective. A lot of the very poor didn't pay the salt tax at all. What they would do instead is burn vegetable ashes, and there would be impure or bitter salt substitutes, which they would extract from those ashes. That wasn't really good for them, and it also tasted bad. The salt issue really was major practical and moral grievance for decades.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLY1COIu9fg
Gandhi and the Salt March,"It's no surprise that Gandhi chose it as the subject of protest. Intuitively, Gandhi had a  very good sense of the economics. He was living in a situation where the price was quite high, and the quantity and quality of salt were fairly low. He wanted to move to a situation where the price would be much lower, and the quantity and quality would be much higher. And thus, we have Gandhi's 1930 Dandi March.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLY1COIu9fg
Gandhi and the Salt March,"At the end of the march, when they all arrived at the sea, what they did is boiled the sea water and took out the salt. They produced salt very cheaply, and basically announced that a new era of salt production and distribution had arrived. Think of this as an economist's kind of perfect competition. The final result was they were arrested. The actual tax on salt wasn't repealed until 1946, but still, this event was important for a number of reasons.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLY1COIu9fg
Gandhi and the Salt March,"It meant new popularity for Gandhi, it demonstrated the widespread nature of resistance to British rule. Also, the issue was so obvious, the salt taxation and  monopoly seemed so unjust, that British rule itself appeared unjustified. There was face-to-face negotiation between Gandhi and the British, which was important symbolically, and also at the end of the Salt March, although Gandhi and also Nehru were arrested, the British actually did make some concessions. For further reading about Gandhi and the Salt March itself, just Google some of the  key terms in this video. For background on the earlier history of salt monopoly and salt taxation, I recommend these two articles, each available online.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLY1COIu9fg
India since Independence,"We're going to spend a lot of time talking about economic problems in India. But just to keep this all in perspective, I'd like to stress just how much  economic progress India has made since independence. I'd like to stress just a few simple comparisons. At independence,  India had about 18% literacy. If we look at 2005-2006, by that year,  India has about 60% literacy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3iVD49uHaU
India since Independence,"Those are the years, by the way, picked out by the authors of the study. At the time of independence,  India had about a 9% investment rate.

India's toughest economic times,"Now, let's look at a period which is often considered to be India's toughest economic years, post-independence that is. Arvind Panagariya cites  the years 1965 to 1981 as being especially difficult for India. You should see his book called ""India: The Emerging Giant"". Unfortunately, this isn't online  and it isn't free, but it's probably the best single book on the economic history of India over the last several decades. In these videos, we really try to go out of our way to avoid criticizing or, for that matter, praising individual politicians.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqIEKHIJcyA
India's toughest economic times,"But, still, if one looks objectively at the historical evidence as an economist, it's difficult to resist the conclusion  that part of India's problem was that Indira Gandhi, who was prime minister during many of these years, had instituted some fairly  bad economic policies. Just to consider a few of those policies. More firms require  government permission for layoffs. That is, any firm with  a hundred employees or more which wanted to lay people off needed permission from the government. Of course, as it becomes  harder to fire people, firms are also less likely  to hire them in the first place.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqIEKHIJcyA
India's toughest economic times,"Regulations on foreign  investment increased and it became much tougher to be  a successful foreign investor in India. This also hurt prosperity and  made it harder to create jobs. Foreign exchange was much more tightly  rationed through government regulation and the government of Indira Gandhi  nationalized significant segments of banks, oil and coal. Finally, in general, larger scale  enterprises were very much penalized by law and regulation and they faced especially  high economic burdens in trying to produce and also create jobs. There's much more detail to  this era, as you'll find discussed in the Panagariya book, but this is just an overview of some  of the domestic economic policies which hurt India's economic prosperity.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqIEKHIJcyA
India's toughest economic times,"Just to illustrate how bad things got. If you look at the period  1965-66 to 1974-75, during those years,  capita income grew by just 0.3%. Of course, that was during a time  when many other economies such as South Korea and Japan were  growing at much for more rapid rates. Do note that through  this broader troubled era, stretching through the early 80s, bad economic policy was  far from the only problem. So, for instance, these years  brought some wars with Pakistan to oil price shocks, a fair amount of bad weather, and also in India the emergency rule  from 1975 to 1977 damaged the country's reputation and made it seem less appealing from  the point of view of foreign investors.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqIEKHIJcyA
India's toughest economic times,"Finally, there were some better  policies in the early 1980s and many of these came under  the fourth term of Indira Gandhi. These include some fiscal reforms, import licensing was eased  which made international trade easier and it made it easier for Indian firms  to buy useful inputs from abroad. There was a reduction of import duties which would be followed up  upon much more later. And, in general, these years  in the early 1980s they laid the foundation for later reforms by showing that reforms are possible and would yield some kind of economic payoff. The early 1980s were  the beginning of a period where India was really starting to see  some better economic times ahead.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqIEKHIJcyA
India's growth inflection,"Now, let's talk about India's growth inflection, the period of time when India  started growing much more rapidly and why that happened when it did. The key issue, sometimes  considered a paradox, has to do with the timing of when India started growing more rapidly. So, for instance, the key economic reforms came in the early 1990s, and we have a separate video on those. Yet, here's the thing. In the post-reform decade, India had an average rate  of growth of about 6%.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vH8k017Q9WA
India's growth inflection,"But in the pre-reform decade, India had an average rate  of growth of about 5.7%, so it would seem that  the reforms barely mattered. That's inconsistent, both with the stories you usually hear about India's reforms and with basic economic theory. Just to show you that same fact in the form of a picture; this is a log scale, but there's a cut-off point  at around 1980. And what you can see is that after 1980 the rate of economic growth  is fairly robust. Before 1980, the rate of  economic growth is much lower.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vH8k017Q9WA
India's growth inflection,"Yet, what exactly is it  that happened around 1980? And in this picture, if you compare the 1980s to the 1990s, there doesn't really seem to be a significant difference. The way a log scale is interpreted, that just seems to be a fairly steady rate of economic progress. I don't consider this  a fully settled question, but let's consider some possible views. One is that many of the real reforms came earlier than the 1991-92 period often cited.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vH8k017Q9WA
India's growth inflection,"For instance, something called  the open general licensing list which made it easier  to have international trade; that list was steadily expanded  in the late 1980s. Also in the late 1980s, foreign exchange constraints were relaxed, capital good imports were eased, and India move toward having a more realistic and indeed  lower exchange rate. If you look at when information  technology companies in India really started to make some progress; that too was in the late 1980s and in part that was able to happen  because of these general improvements. A different kind of class of  explanation looks at the 1990s and tries to explain why the 1990s  weren't better than they were. One factor that decided is that India, over this period and still to this day, has had lower savings and investment than a lot of the East Asian Tigers.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vH8k017Q9WA
India's growth inflection,"Also in the 1990s, China was doing extremely well in industrial areas and manufacturing, there was a lot of competition from China, and what's striking about the 1990s, the one area where India  seems to be underperforming, it is exactly that, namely,  lackluster industrial growth. A related tack is to look at  the growth in the 1980s and ask why that growth  was as high as it was. Keep in mind that the Indian reforms of the early 90s; they came about precisely because India had met a financial crisis which came about from too much borrowing and unsustainable public finances. So arguably, the growth of the 1980s was itself not sustainable. So, the 1980s are looking artificially good because it's based on  pumping up the economy in a number of unsustainable ways, and in part, the 1990s don't look  quite as good as the otherwise might because then time has come  to pay that bill and make some of  the necessary adjustments.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vH8k017Q9WA
India's growth inflection,"Keep in mind that the decade of the 1980s often had fairly high variance  in growth rates, that the strongest performance  in economic growth was toward the end of the period. Part of that may have to do with  the information technology companies, which were getting started. In the early 90s, that really did  cut down the budget deficit and move India toward a sounder footing. But we know from experience  with other countries, when you institute good reforms, it really can take a number of years before you reap all of the benefits of those reforms, sometimes up to a decade or more. Another factor is that the late 1990s saw slower economic growth for a lot of Asia and  a lot of developing economies.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vH8k017Q9WA
India's growth inflection,"Some of this may have come  from the East Asian financial crisis, even though India was  relatively insulated from that crisis. It may have increased uncertainty and simply slow down  economic growth somewhat. This is a very complex topic  and it really does force us to rethink: Just what were the important Indian reforms? When did they start to matter and through what channels did they start to matter? As I've mentioned, we probably should not consider this a fully settled topic.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vH8k017Q9WA
India's growth inflection,"One possible lesson is simply that it can be very difficult to tell exactly what is driving a particular episode of economic growth or a particular upward or downward movement in rates of change for economic growth. Anyway, to read more on this topic, I would recommend these four pieces, they're all online. I would think of these as really being especially deep and especially thoughtful concerning the larger issues surrounding Indian reforms and Indian economic growth.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vH8k017Q9WA
India's reforms of the 1990s,"-[Narrator] Now, let's talk about some of  India's key economic reforms, many of which started in the early 1990s. For the most part, these reforms  liberalized markets and helped India grow. One part of these reforms included a significant cut in tariffs. So, for instance,  at the time of 1991-1992, the average tariff rate was over 72%. That's quite high.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5OnaC3HmyI
India's reforms of the 1990s,"By the time the mid-90s roll around, that rate has gone down to about 24%. There's also an economic concept called the effective rate of protection, which has to do with how much tariffs really matter. And from the period 1960-1985, this rate was remarkably high. When Indians tried to buy intermediate inputs to help their businesses, the rate during that period averaged about 147%. And, of course, that's a  considerable disincentive to starting or expanding an enterprise.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5OnaC3HmyI
India's reforms of the 1990s,"During this time, it also  became much easier to spend foreign exchange on inputs, although, note, some of those reforms had already been started in the 1980s. The whole idea of ""Made in India"" as an explicit goal of economic policy very much moved to the background. India was moving to freer trade, and it was becoming a closer and more integrated part of the global economy, also with respect to foreign investment. The Indian reformers also dismantled a lot of the country's earlier industrial policy. So before the early 1990s, 18 industries were considered more or less the sole province of the public sector, and a lot of  those industries were quite important, including iron and steel, heavy plant and machinery, telecom, minerals, oil, mining, air transportation, electricity, and insurance.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5OnaC3HmyI
India's reforms of the 1990s,"By the time the reforms were over, there were pretty much just  three sectors left, which were then considered the more or less sole province for public activity, and those had to do with defense, nuclear energy, and rail. FDI was liberalized, that stands for foreign direct investment, so it now was the case that 100% foreign ownership was to be allowed, although not for every sector, not for banks, telecom, insurance, and airlines. Banking was another area that started to see some significant changes. Among the new policies were removing interest rate controls, easing licensing for foreign exchange, and raising capital requirements  for banks so they would be safer. But keep in mind the  banking sector as a whole, that even today in India, most banks are still  public sector entities, so there was some liberalization in this sector, but it was within the context where most of the banking sector remains state-owned.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5OnaC3HmyI
India's reforms of the 1990s,"There was also an entire set of  macroeconomic reforms, which were more or less forced on India by a financial crisis. Those involved the budget and  exchange rates, among other features, and we'll be covering those separately. Perhaps most importantly, these reforms  involved a new vision for India, and a new sense of what the  Indian economy would be. That is more globalized, freer,  more liberalized, and moving away from earlier notions of five-year plans and industrial policy. But that said, keep in mind, while these reforms were quite significant, there were still very large parts  of the Indian economy which have very heavy levels of  regulation, price controls, bureaucracy, and are subject to burdens and taxes from corruption.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5OnaC3HmyI
India's reforms of the 1990s,"So it's hardly the case that these reforms brought India to being  any kind of free market economy. That simply didn't happen. For further reading in this area, here are some good sources to start with. They're online, and also you can Google  any of the basic terms in the areas we've been discussing. The references in these two pieces also are extremely useful.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5OnaC3HmyI
India's reforms of the 1990s,"I would recommend some of the other videos, in particular the one on India's growth inflection to get a better understanding of just what these reforms did and did not manage to succeed with.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5OnaC3HmyI
Trade and Poverty in India,"What happened to poverty in India  when the country moved to freer trade? After independence from Great Britain, trade policy in India turned  in the direction of high tariffs and protectionism. The goal was that things consumed  in India would be made in India. It was even quite difficult to get  a hold of an American Coca-Cola in India during this period. As of 1990, the average tariff in India  was about 80% which, of course, is very high.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbtQmZThczw
Trade and Poverty in India,"That meant higher prices  for consumers; for instance, consumers who wanted to buy soft drinks; and it also meant that India was investing a lot of its resources producing goods and services, when maybe it wasn't the most  efficient or effective producer of those goods and services. Reform did come to India -- and, in 1991, India started a process of opening itself up to the global economy. So, whereas the average tariff  had been at 80% in 1990, by the time we get to 1996, the average tariff is  at a lower rate of 37%. It's also the case that -- the standard deviation of tariffs  dropped by about 50% during the same time period. What that means is that  those extremely prohibitively high tariffs of about 300% or 400%; for the most part, those were done away with.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbtQmZThczw
Trade and Poverty in India,"So, tariffs were both lower and the most extremely high  tariffs were eliminated. In this new situation, India both  imported more and exported more. So, for instance, in the 1980s, -- the ratio of total trade and  manufacturers to GDP was at about 13%. By the time we get to  the year 2000, it's at about 19%, much higher of course. The question under consideration is:  What did this change do for poverty?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbtQmZThczw
Trade and Poverty in India,"Well, when we think about how trade affects poverty, there are a few major effects. The first simply is that by being  more open to foreign trade, a country achieves lower prices  by having more competition and by having more access  to cheap imports. A second effect is that by being  more open to trade, a country exports more and this produces jobs at home, and it raises real wages, and it's overall good for the economy. There is, however, a potential negative effect. When a country becomes  more open to foreign trade, its previous businesses,  which were doing well, now have to face more foreign competition.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbtQmZThczw
Trade and Poverty in India,"Some of those businesses  will now do less well, some of them may go under altogether, and, of course, that will eliminate  some jobs and also lower some wages. The net effect of trade  on poverty will depend upon how these major effects  and some others all fit together. In most cases in world history, trade has done more to remove poverty and, when we look at the data for India,  this is exactly the same result we see. For instance, it is found that, for every one percentage point reduction in the tariff rate, there is a 0.57% reduction  in the rate of poverty. If we look at the overall reduction  in poverty across the time period, 1987 to 2004, when poverty in India really  did go down quite a bit, it has been found that 38%  of this reduction in poverty can be attributed to India's  greater openness to foreign trade.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbtQmZThczw
Trade and Poverty in India,"That is quite a significant effect. It's not that everyone was better off, but the gains really did  significantly outweigh the losses. To read more on this topic  and to take a closer look at where these numbers come from, I would recommend that  you google to the first source listed. There is also a very good book  by Bhagwati and Panagariya, but that unfortunately is  not available online for free. It's called 'India's Reforms.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbtQmZThczw
Agriculture in India,"The agricultural sector  in Indian has remained one of the country's major economic problems. Let's look at this a little more closely. The main problem quite simply is low productivity in agriculture. So in India agriculture accounts for about 16% of the economy, but it takes up about half of the workforce. For one thing, that is implying those workers are not very productive.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSBvgXNQ520
Agriculture in India,"Low productivity will mean, for those workers, low real wages. That also means that India doesn't  produce enough food and it's not cheap enough  so that anyone can afford it. So we find that in India,  according to some estimates, about half of all children under five suffer from some form of malnutrition. Why is there low productivity in Indian agriculture? These aren't all of the reasons, but here are a few.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSBvgXNQ520
Agriculture in India,"First, there are restrictions on businesses owning land and this tends to keep farms  inefficiently small. Also in India, generally, it's the case that larger businesses are more heavily regulated, and that tends to keep agricultural businesses relatively small, often too small. There are very serious restrictions on foreign investment which would allow for an upgrade of agricultural methods and technologies. Very often, the government controls prices which can lead to shortages or surplus; we discuss that elsewhere in this course, in the food section. Another problem is that the Indian government often limits exports.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSBvgXNQ520
Agriculture in India,"So farmers, knowing that they will not be able to export their crop or export surplus crops, they grow less of those crops in the first place. Furthermore, India, generally, has problems with poor enforcement and recording of land titles. So land titles are not always secure, and, in general, there are contractual problems between landlords and tenants. Landlords are often reluctant  to conclude deals with tenants knowing that that they may lose some of their property rights in the process. This is not a comprehensive list, it's just some of the problems.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSBvgXNQ520
Agriculture in India,"Oh, one further problem, and this is a big one: weak roads and infrastructure. It's often very difficult to get  Indian crops from Indian farms to the proper markets. The roads are either not paved, or they are unreliable, or they are not available  every time of the year. Or, even if the road is paved, it may be very slow, and unreliable, and often dangerous. It's not like this road pictured here in the photograph where it's perfectly smooth, empty, and clear sailing.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSBvgXNQ520
Agriculture in India,"India did see major agricultural  productivity gains in the Green Revolution, earlier in the 20th century. This brought rising yields  in the 1960s and 1970s due largely to better seeds and stronger crops. Yet, this Green Revolution pioneered by Norman Borlaug, shown here, has slowed down in recent times. For more on the Green Revolution, you can view our video unit on that topic. In general, the Indian economy  has a long-standing tradition of productivity problems in agriculture, and if we look back to the first half of the 20th century, we see that low productivity in agriculture then is also a persistent and nagging concern.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSBvgXNQ520
Agriculture in India,"Now, let's look at what is both some good news and some bad news. The good news is that in the year 2012 there was in fact in India  a record wheat stockpile. Ok, so what's the bad news? The bad news is that  at least 2/3 of this crop rots on the way to market, and, if anything, that 2/3 is  probably an underestimate. Here is one very simple way  to think about some of the problems.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSBvgXNQ520
Agriculture in India,"First, the government buys  a lot of wheat from farmers. Second, the price the government is paying for wheat is up about 70% since 2007. That, of course, encourages  more wheat production, but, arguably in this case,  too much wheat is being produced. For really a long time, storage capacity in India for the wheat has not been upgraded, so there is all this surplus wheat and, quite simply, really nowhere to put it. You might think, 'Ah, well, the Indian government could export that wheat.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSBvgXNQ520
Agriculture in India,"' But, circa the summer of 2012, the government was paying, say typically, $346 for a ton of wheat, and the global price for comparable kinds of wheat was about $260 a ton. So it appears the government is overpaying. You might also think, why doesn't the government just take the wheat and give it away to poorer Indians? And, probably, that's what they should do. But there are so many regulations  on the distribution and procurement of wheat that this actually isn't nearly as easy as it should be.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSBvgXNQ520
Agriculture in India,"There are many particular problems with agricultural productivity in India, and we've looked at only a few. But the bottom line really is this: the Indian economy really does have many dynamic sectors but agriculture has seen much less progress. We also know, from development economics  more generally, that if you are looking for a sector to have productivity gains in a way that will reduce poverty  and extreme poverty in your country, agriculture is really the place you would not want those productivity problems to come. So the difficulty with agricultural  productivity in India has been a very significant contributor to problems of poverty in that country. There are many, many sources on this problem, but for further reading,  here are just a few I'd recommend.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSBvgXNQ520
Agriculture in India,"The articles by Maurice Landes listed here, my own book, An Economist Gets Lunch, and two very good highly readable online articles. One is As Crops Rot, Millions Go Hungry. The other is Galloping Growth,  and Hunger in India.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSBvgXNQ520
Green Revolution,"The Green Revolution is one of the most important events of the 20th century and it has led to many  millions of people being fed when they otherwise would  have starved or gone hungry. A green revolution refers  most generally to an increase in  the productivity of agriculture. But our green revolution  starts with Norman Borlaug, an American who eventually  won a Nobel Peace Prize. Borlaug was an American scientist  and in the mid 1940s he found himself working in central Mexico as part of a Rockefeller Foundation  program to improve crop yields. He came up with some major breakthroughs, including rust-resistant wheat crops, shuttle breeding programs  to accelerate crop engineering and stronger and  higher yielding wheat plants.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbr5pGiYYgk
Green Revolution,"Rather than just keeping this knowledge to himself, Borlaug tried to spread it to  his many Mexican farmers as possible. And among the Mexican farmers,  he was known for his willingness to get his hands dirty and just go over there out in the fields and work with them. Basically, these ideas worked. Borlaug is best thought of as a kind of genius offshoot innovator from  a more general increase of agricultural productivity  in the United States. For instance, between 1880 and 1940, agricultural productivity  in the United States was going up by about 1% a year.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbr5pGiYYgk
Green Revolution,"That's OK, but after World War II, the trend rate of growth went up to about 2.8% a year. So this was a time when American agriculture itself was flourishing. This was due to more and better fertilizer, greater and better use of mechanized vehicles, better crops and hybrids, larger farms, and in general the application of  large-scale business and business management to growing food. Borlaug took some of these ideas,  improved them and adapted them for use  to developing countries. In the early 1960s, the green revolution started to spread to South Asia, most notably India and Pakistan.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbr5pGiYYgk
Green Revolution,"And this was due in large part to  the personal efforts of Norman Borlaug. During 1969 to 1970, 55% of the wheat hectares sown in Pakistan used Mexican or Mexican derived varieties of wheat. In India it was 35% of wheat hectares sown. Domestic farmers in India and Pakistan were big advocates of this green revolution and they did the rest of the work and their political leaders allowed  this change to happen. By 1970, the countries with significant increases in cereal production due to the green revolution were Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, then called Ceylon, Indonesia, Iran, Kenya, Morocco, Malaysia, Thailand, Tunisia and Turkey.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbr5pGiYYgk
Green Revolution,"Later in the 1970s,  Borlaug encouraged the Chinese to move to a more productive  variety of hybrid rice. Before the green revolution,  it was a common prediction that the developing world was  facing a future of mass starvation. In large part this green revolution  was not foreseen by commentators. Now, it's the case that the world is  feeding many more people than ever before. Yield rates on various crops  rose dramatically.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbr5pGiYYgk
Green Revolution,"They rose for grains, they rose  for cereals, they rose for a rice and they rose most of all for wheat by nearly a factor of fourfold. That's a comparison 1950 to 1998 for India kilograms per hectare. The green revolution has  been extremely impressive and of course much of the developing world picked up where Norman Borlaug left off. To read more on the green revolution,  google just ""green revolution"", ""Norman Borlaug"", ""green revolution India"", ""green revolution Pakistan"" and see also my book  ""An Economist gets Lunch"".",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbr5pGiYYgk
Land reform in India,"Land reform is a hard issue to study because it's difficult to see what would have happened in the absence of land reform. Nonetheless, let's take a look at a bit of what we know. We're going to look at this piece  by Tim Besley and Robin Burgess on India. Keep in mind, in general,  the economic results of land reform can be either positive or negative. The negative scenario is  pretty straightforward.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_bn0FyqoQU
Land reform in India,"If the government confiscates or somehow alters property rights on land, investors may be less willing to put resources into agricultural improvements. Security of property rights is an important precondition for economic growth. On the positive side, land reform  may remedy inequality, and it also may give people  who work on the land a greater stake  in agricultural productivity, and thus increase their effort,  because, after land reform, they're not simply working for other people. The relative strength of these various effects, of course, depends on context and we're going to look at data  from 1958 to 1992, from the major Indian states. What makes the paper work is that  the authors were able to compare the Indian states which had  a good deal of land reform to the Indian states which did not.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_bn0FyqoQU
Land reform in India,"So, under the years of consideration, there was a lot of land reform  in Kerala and Tamil Nadu, but there was not nearly as much in Rajasthan and Punjab. There are four possible types of  land reform during this period. The first was reforming  the terms of tenancy contracts. That is, a state government would intervene and regulate the contract ostensibly in the interest of the tenant. For instance, this kind of regulation might have stipulated that a tenant would receive a minimum share of the output from the land.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_bn0FyqoQU
Land reform in India,"Second, another kind of land reform would abolish intermediaries. Going back to British colonial rule  and also earlier, typically there were feudal lords who would own land and they would hire intermediaries to extract additional revenue  from the people working the land. Most Indian states already had abolished these intermediaries before 1958, but it turns out that five Indian states abolished these intermediaries  only after 1958. Third, another kind of land reform could put a ceiling on how much land  a single landowner could hold. And finally, the fourth kind of land reform could allow for a consolidation  of landholdings and, in effect, remove ceilings on how much land an individual landholder could hold.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_bn0FyqoQU
Land reform in India,"It's going to turn out these four kinds of land reform have different effects, and, in general, when someone talks  about land reform, land reform isn't a single thing, it can mean many different things with, of course, different economic analysis for each. When we look at the data, it turns out that land reform really is correlated with a falling rate of rural poverty. Yet, it's only two kinds of  land reform which matter. It's tenancy reforms and  the abolition of intermediaries. Legislation having to do with land ceilings, and land holdings, and concentration don't seem to matter for rural poverty.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_bn0FyqoQU
Land reform in India,"You might wonder, what does this correlation mean? After all, it's possible that the very existence of land reform is simply proxying for a fact  that maybe a state cares about its poor citizens in some other way. So land reform and the decline  in rural poverty may be correlated not because there's a causal relationship but because land reform is  proxying for other policies. To try to take this into account,  the authors also look at urban poverty rates. If land reform were proxying for  a more general set of policies, we would expect land reform  to be correlated with especially steep falls  in urban poverty rates, but it turns out that it's not.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_bn0FyqoQU
Land reform in India,"So maybe there is some unique  rural effect resulting from land reform. Nonetheless, not all of the economic  effects of land reform are positive. Following a reform in tenancy regulations, it actually turns out that  agricultural output per capita Falls. What does this mean? Poverty is going down, but agricultural output  per capita is going down too.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_bn0FyqoQU
Land reform in India,"It seems to be that what's happening is the way the land is being worked is less efficient, but more of the gains of what  are being produced are going to the poor people  working the land. In other words, there's  an equity-efficiency trade-off. Land reform does seem  to make matters more equitable, but it also makes agricultural  production less efficient when we're talking about land reform that affects the terms of  contracts with tenants. That was pretty close to our original  microeconomic analysis, namely that land reform can  have some negative effects and land reform can also have  some positive effects. Just to put together a few results  from the paper on one slide.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_bn0FyqoQU
Land reform in India,"Following some kinds of land reform, rural poverty goes down,  agricultural wages go up, rural per capita income  from agriculture goes down following reforms to tenancy, and there's an equity-efficiency trade-off for tenancy reform, but there's no equity efficiency trade-off for abolishing intermediaries. When you abolish intermediaries  from that kind of land reform, there's no negative effect on rural  per capita income from agriculture. Overall, there's a great deal which  economists do not know about land reform and land reform is very difficult to study systematically. it really does depend on context, whether the positive or the negative results will be more important. Nonetheless, this paper is at least a start on a very difficult topic.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_bn0FyqoQU
Power generation in India,"[Narrator] Power generation is one of  the most serious problems in the Indian economy right now, so let's look at this a little more closely. It's well-known that there was a major power blackout in India in the summer of 2012. It left several hundred million people without power, but what's perhaps most striking is that hundreds of millions of Indians didn't notice this power blackout at all. It's because it was already the case that 3-4 hundred million Indians are already not connected to any electrical power source. One general problem is that regulations very often hold down the cost of power in India, so that the price which companies can set for power is actually less than their marginal cost.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWhc21HS2QE
Power generation in India,"So the companies receive instructions to connect various rural areas to the electrical grid, but it's not actually worthwhile or profitable for the companies to make sure this actually happens. The net result is that many people are left unconnected. One result of this lack of connections is simply that many Indians, hundreds of millions in fact, burn traditional fuels. This includes wood, it includes agricultural waste, and it includes biomass cakes. These are used for cooking and eating at home.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWhc21HS2QE
Power generation in India,"But burning these fuels in cook stoves is considered inefficient. it releases high levels of smoke and particulate matter, and it's believed a fair number of people die of carbon monoxide and other forms of indoor air pollutants. But without direct electrical connections, of course, these burnings are likely to continue. Another problem common in India is simply theft of electricity. That is cutting into someone else's power line and taking the electricity as your own, without in any way paying for it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWhc21HS2QE
Power generation in India,"Perhaps $4-5 billion worth of electricity is stolen in India each year. Power and energy problems are actually constraining Indian business. About 55% of India's electricity comes from coal, but in 2011, coal production increased only about 1%, even though the Indian economy was growing quite a bit. Not enough coal was being dug up and burned to supply the power needs. Companies are demanding more power than the network is able to supply.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWhc21HS2QE
Power generation in India,"Blackouts are now so common that it's frequent that factories will turn to their own diesel generators rather than to the power grid, even though the diesel generators may cost about three times as much. There was a research survey done of businesses, asking what is the single most important obstacle for the operation and growth of the firm. The answers were revealing. The most common response was electricity, problems with electricity, and that was the answer of 31%. Next was 22%, citing tax issues, and then 10% citing governance.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWhc21HS2QE
Power generation in India,"But electricity came in as the number one problem for business. One problem is a state-controlled company, Coal India, which controls about 80% of Indian coal production. The company is often required to sell coal at up to a 70% discount to market prices. The net result is that the company simply doesn't have the incentive to invest enough in new mines and technologies. Furthermore, there have been recent scandals about the allocation of coal rights in India, sometimes called Coalgate.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWhc21HS2QE
Power generation in India,"This has contributed to the general scent that there's simply something wrong with the allocation of coal in modern India today. Burning coal in India does involve a lot of environmental problems, and arguably it would be better if India could rely more upon its cleaner supplies of natural gas. These supplies in India are plentiful, yet there's a problem. These supplies of natural gas are subject to price controls. That is, government artificially holds down the price of natural gas, and that means the incentive to supply natural gas is correspondingly weaker because of the legally controlled low price.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWhc21HS2QE
Power generation in India,"Overall, when it comes to power generation, India simply hasn't managed its basic policies very well. To read more on this topic, you can try Googling to these sources. There are in particular some good articles from The New York Times on this topic. These are some good Google key words, and also here, referring to coal, natural gas, and price controls. And finally, this article, which is available online, is the source for our information as to what are the main obstacles for expanding Indian businesses.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWhc21HS2QE
Foreign investment in India,now let's look at some of the problems India has had attracting foreign investment as you'll recall from some of her other videos foreign investment tends to raise wages and levels of productivity one recent story is that of a ski resort or rather a ski resort which never came to pass there was an American named John Sims who wanted to build a ski resort in the Himalayas in India yet he has encountered a lot of obstacles this would have been the first western-style ski resort in India it would have been a five hundred million dollar project it would have created a lot of jobs sins even left a deposit but he found there was a lot of local opposition to the project in part because it would have been disruptive but also in part for religious reasons so at first the project was approved and then later it was scrapped after a different political party came to power in that state and eventually he was given only about six months to secure all of the needed environmental permits it seems that won't be possible and most likely this project simply won't happen for another example of some difficulties consider the sector of furniture and home furnishings the globally famous Swedish firm IKEA would like to set up shop in India but so far they have been meeting resistance the main fear is competition with other Indian retailers and also that ek8 will be buying and selling furniture which is made in places other than India so one commentator offered the following thought and this is outlined here I quote honestly the Indian people know how to make furniture they EK ax will not make much of a change they will make the same FDI foreign direct investment is welcome to India but it does not mean you will eat away the ordinary people who make it carpenters and others the realities that ek is likely to bring higher productivity to the sector and this would mean much lower prices for consumers the company ek is asking that it be exempt from the Indian law which would require IKEA to make 30% of its purchases from small and mid-sized Indian producers so far there's been a standoff and as of the time is making this video August 2012 Ukiah is not slated to enter the Indian market we'll be seeing how this develops in general as of late foreign firms have become more reluctant to invest in the Indian economy so in the first six months of 2012 foreign direct investment is actually down about 18 percent from its 2011 pace of course that's a bad sign for the Indian economy a lot of the problems faced by foreign investors or potential foreign investors are fairly deeply rooted those include unpredictable politics slow and inefficient courts and also an unreliable power grid we discuss some of these problems in some other videos there are some FDI successes in India those would include some of the older firms with listed subsidiaries such as Siemens Unilever and Suzuki and also Hyundai the Korean auto manufacturer has set up some plans and they did this by picking some of the Indian states with better run governments nonetheless there's a general consensus that when it comes to foreign direct investment India has not had enough successes this video is about some quite recent developments and so the key sources are taken from the popular press to useful articles are listed here but for updates simply take the phrase foreign direct investment India and either put it into Google or put it into news. google.com or put in the names of the individual companies mentioned in this video along with the word India or foreign direct investment and put that into news.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dlcOoSi8xU
Labor market regulation,"Now let's look at the Indian history  of labor market regulation. We'll consider data starting in 1958  and running up through the early 90s when India engaged in some  serious economic reforms. And this analysis and  the underlying data is taken from ""Can Labor Regulation Hinder Economic  Performance? Evidence from India,"" by Timothy Besley and Robin Burgess. The key point here will be that trying to overprotect labor through excessive regulation can actually hurt laborers and also hurt the interests of the poor.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vzk18dBvoNk
Labor market regulation,"Let's see how this works. The Industrial Disputes Act of 1947 is a key piece of legislation here. This is federal law and it sets out the procedures to be followed when there's some kind of labor dispute. But it's not just a federal law. The way the Indian  system of government works there are also state-level amendments,  which of course vary by state, and over the time period we're looking at there are 113 amendments to consider.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vzk18dBvoNk
Labor market regulation,"And the authors of the study  classify these, at least superficially, as being pro-worker,  pro-employer or neutral. For instance, an amendment  which made it harder to fire workers would be classified as pro-worker, which at least on the surface it might appear to be. Again, these amendments will be varying across different Indian states. The states which take a neutral stance to labor market regulation are listed here. The states which take a  pro-employer stance are listed here.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vzk18dBvoNk
Labor market regulation,"And finally, these are the four states which are classified as having a pro-worker stance in their amendments. The thing is, not all of these states  have had the same economic performance when it comes to manufacturing. For India as a whole manufacturing output over this period grew at about 3.3% but some states did better than others. For instance, in West Bengal, it grew  at a rate of only about 1.5% a year and in Andhra Pradesh,  it grew at a rate of about 6% a year. What we find in the data is that overall,  perhaps counter-intuitively, it's the states which have  the pro-employer amendments which have done better  in terms of manufacturing growth.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vzk18dBvoNk
Labor market regulation,"Why might this be? Besley and Burgess, the authors, think  it has something to do with investment. If a state implements a lot of regulations which ostensibly are pro-labor this limits the incentive for investment. So fewer jobs will be created and the manufacturing sector will be more robust. When employers and investors have  stronger rights vis-a-vis labor, this actually increases  the incentive for investment.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vzk18dBvoNk
Labor market regulation,"So passing laws which appear  to boost the rights of labor may in some ways be counterproductive. Besley and Burgess think  this is actually a fairly large effect. Here's a quotation from their paper: ""If West Bengal had not passed  any pro-worker amendments, it would have enjoyed  a registered manufacturing output that was 24% higher than its 1990 level  and employment that was 23% higher"". In other words, that would mean more jobs. When it comes to manufacturing, we can see there's been a relative change  of fortune across various Indian states.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vzk18dBvoNk
Labor market regulation,"So in the year 1960, the pro-worker states actually had  the higher per capita manufacturing output but by the time 1990 rolls around,  that's simply no longer true. Here are some other  results from the paper. First, the so-called pro-worker laws don't much harm agricultural output. This suggests that what the researchers are identifying is an actual connection between the pro-worker laws and  slower growth in the manufacturing sector. It suggests that the pro-worker laws  are not just some kind of proxy for other mistakes in economic policy  because if there were such a proxy, you would think that would harm  agricultural output as well.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vzk18dBvoNk
Labor market regulation,"The authors also find that these pro-worker laws don't  very much harm the construction sector. Those laws are not applied there by the way. It's also the case that having  a lot of pro-worker laws in a state appears to boost the informal sector,  which suggests there's substitution. So if one sector is highly regulated, what a lot of individuals who still want  to manufacture something in that state do is move to the informal economy, where they're not subject to the same regulations. And overall, they also find that pro-worker laws, in general,  do not boost wages.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vzk18dBvoNk
Labor market regulation,"Finally, when supposedly pro-worker laws  are applied in an individual state, this means, in the data,  that urban poverty goes up relative to the base of  trends in India at the time. This study by Besley and Burgess is an important paper and as you can imagine it's created a fair amount of controversy. The main result may seem counterintuitive, but it's actually in accord with some  pretty standard economic reasoning. And the basic point is, what makes workers better off is higher productivity. Simply using the law to try to redress the balance between employers and workers may either be ineffective or  it may backfire altogether.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vzk18dBvoNk
Labor market regulation,"If you'd like to read more about this area, here are two papers we recommend. The first is about India. The second is a more  general look at the topic. And both are available online.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vzk18dBvoNk
Mobility in the caste system,"Now, let's look at mobility  in the Indian caste system and how that mobility  has increased in recent times. We'll consider the Scheduled  Caste and Tribes, groups which were formally defined  in the Indian Constitution of 1950. Historically, these have been  disadvantaged groups in India. Researchers find that their  educational and income mobility is converging to levels  for Non-Scheduled groups. For education, we can ask: What is the probability of an individual from Scheduled Castes or Tribes changing the level of education  across one generation?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVBeb7j0mKA
Mobility in the caste system,"If we go back to 1983, that probability was 42%. In 2004-2005, that probability has gone up to 67%. To put that in perspective, compare it to the probabilities for Non-Scheduled Castes/Tribes. That Probability went from 57% to 67%. What we can see is that,  by 2004-2005 for both groups, it was 67%.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVBeb7j0mKA
Mobility in the caste system,"For the Scheduled Castes  and Tribes, the largest changes are movements out of illiteracy  to being able to read and write. Now, let's consider income, specifically the median wage premium comparing the Non-Scheduled Castes and Non-Scheduled Tribes groups to the Scheduled Castes  and Scheduled Tribes groups. As of 1983, the Non-Scheduled Castes  and Non-Scheduled Tribes enjoyed a median wage premium of 36%. By 2004-2005, that premium had fallen to about 21%. Just to put that in perspective, that's smaller than the gap between White and African-American incomes in the United States.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVBeb7j0mKA
Mobility in the caste system,"We can also consider elasticity of income for the Scheduled Castes  and Scheduled Tribes groups. That is, we're comparing now the children with respect to their parents. If the parents earn, say,  an extra 1000 rupees a year, over time, how much more can we be expecting children from those families to be earning. In 1983, that elasticity  was quite high, 0.9. That means that the incomes  of parents are quite well predicting the subsequent  incomes of their children.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVBeb7j0mKA
Mobility in the caste system,"Yet, by 2004-2005, that elasticity had gone down to 0.55. For the Non-Scheduled Castes  and Non-Scheduled Tribes, that elasticity in 2004-2005  is sitting at about 0.61. That means for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes the incomes of parents actually  have less predictive power for the incomes of children compared to the Non-Scheduled Castes and Non-Scheduled Tribes. That indicates rising income mobility. Overall, for the Scheduled Castes  and Scheduled Tribes, it can be said that socio-economic mobility has been rising over the last 20 years.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVBeb7j0mKA
Mobility in the caste system,"One Dalit businessman put it quite well. He said, ""We are fighting  the caste system with capitalism"". A Dalit activist put it this way: ""Because of the new market economy, material markers are replacing social markers. Dalits can buy rank in  the market economy. India is moving from a caste-based to a class-based society where, if you have all the goodies in life and your bank account is booming, you are acceptable"".",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVBeb7j0mKA
Mobility in the caste system,"And, indeed in India, we are now  finding millionaires coming from the more disadvantaged groups, typically rising up  through small business. Looking for the reasons of  this partial convergence of fates, I've already mentioned economic reforms  and also the freer economy in India, but it's not just that. There's also been a strengthening of caste-based networks and the lower castes now have  greater representation in politics. To read more on this fascinating topic, well, at the popular level, there's that New York Times article referenced earlier. But to take a look at  the numbers and the formal research, there are two papers  by Hnatkovska, Lahiri, and Paul, and they are here and  they are both available online.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVBeb7j0mKA
Corruption in driver's licenses,"Very often, the social cost from corruption isn't really well captured by the notion of people having to pay bribes. The true and proper social costs have to do with lower quality social outcomes. We're going to look at the country of India and the topic of corruption in the issuing of driver's licenses. I'll be drawing on a very good paper on corruption and it is entitled ""Obtaining a Driver's License in India"". The author set out to answer a pretty simple question: Should this guy be on the road or not?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuBM95_Eamc
Corruption in driver's licenses,"It turns out the answer is going to be a little scary and that's because of corruption. The author set up an experiment to try to figure out how corrupt was the process of issuing driver's licenses in India. There are three different groups involved. First, they took a randomly selected group and offered them a bonus if those individuals could get a license, especially fast. The quickest you could get a license in this context was within 32 days.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuBM95_Eamc
Corruption in driver's licenses,"There is a second group, also randomly selected and that group was taken aside and given driving lessons There was a third group and that group was left alone as they just navigated the process of getting a driver's license in India. At the end of all of this investigation,  what the authors are going to do is compare the three groups and see what we can learn  from that comparison. The important point here is that  one group has a special incentive to navigate the process especially quickly, that's the first group. The people in that first group; they generally hired a bunch of individuals who are called agents. These agents help you navigate the driver's license process in India.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuBM95_Eamc
Corruption in driver's licenses,"The agents, in effect,  they bribe the process for you. You don't have to engage in the corruption yourself. You hire the agent to help you. The agent knows the ins and outs of the bureaucracy. And, basically, the agent issues some bribes to make sure you can get a license, and you can get a license quickly.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuBM95_Eamc
Corruption in driver's licenses,"That's what's going on with the first group. So, what are the results? This first group of individuals, who are paid the bonus if they got licenses quickly; they did in fact get the licenses quickly due to the aid of the agents, and they got the licenses  at a higher rate. 71% of the group paid the bonus, got the licenses, whereas, in the control group, only 48% of them managed to get the licenses. In other words, some of the individuals were paying to get the licenses, when really maybe they should not have had the licenses at all.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuBM95_Eamc
Corruption in driver's licenses,"You can think of this picture as one instance of  the social costs of corruption. Just how big is this problem? Well, it turns out it's a somewhat grim story. Of the bonus group, only 38% had to actually take and pass a driving test to get a license That's because of the aid  of these corrupt agents. Those who were in the bonus group who got a license, they were then independently tested to see whether or not  they were good drivers.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuBM95_Eamc
Corruption in driver's licenses,"It turns out that 65% of them failed that test, and maybe those individuals should not be on the road. This is, again, another lesson in the high social costs of corruption.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuBM95_Eamc
Lentils as incentive,"There's one economic study which shows that lentils can be  a quite potent incentive. This took place  in rural Rajasthan, in India, and it involved children, mostly between the ages of 1 and 3. The question was, would the children receive a basic package of immunizations involving immunizations for polio  and measles and also other maladies? The thing is, it would take 5  or more trips to the clinic for the child to receive  all of the immunizations; and the question was, was the parent going to bring  the child enough times to see through this health care benefit? The researchers considered 134 villages and they randomized the treatments assigned to these villages.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfWlL5b7Xl8
Lentils as incentive,"In the control group, well,  that was the status quo. And under the status quo, going to a healthcare clinic and hoping to receive an immunization for one's child; it's not actually a totally  reliable experience. For instance, the healthcare worker simply might not be there or the immunization  might not be available. Knowing this, of course, a lot of parents don't even bother. Treatment A was guaranteeing  reliable immunization.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfWlL5b7Xl8
Lentils as incentive,"That is, if the parent brings  the child to the clinic, the parent knows that the treatment will be there and available. And treatment B was to have  reliable immunization available but also to combine that with an incentive for the parent to bring the child. And that incentive would be a packet of lentils. It was 1 kilogram of lentils which,  in terms of U.S. dollars, is worth about 1 dollar and  that was for each visit; and the parents also would receive a metal plate for each visit as you might eat a thali from. And that was worth about  2 dollars for each visit, one plate per visit.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfWlL5b7Xl8
Lentils as incentive,"Obviously, there is now an incentive  to see through all the visits. So the control group received  the immunizations about 6% of the time which,  of course, is not a great record. The group given reliable treatment received the immunizations 18% of the time. That's 3 times better  but, in absolute terms, it's still hardly impressive. It means you have 82% of the children not getting full immunization.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfWlL5b7Xl8
Lentils as incentive,"And finally, the group that had both the reliable service and the small incentives to bring the children; well, they received the full package  of immunizations 39% of the time, which is still far from perfect, but it's much better than  either the 6% or the 18%. The lesson here is that even fairly small incentives can really matter. This was a study from  the poverty action lab at MIT and you can google to ""improving  immunization coverage in rural India"".",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfWlL5b7Xl8
Testing for Cream Skimming in India,"In the previous video - the rise of private education in India we showed the beginning in the 1990s there was a massive increase in  demand for education, which was met by private schools. So much so that now in India 27% of the primary age children  are in private schools, and in urban regions it is as  high as almost 50%. We also showed that on educational tests the kids in private schools do better than those in public schools. But the question is: is this because  the private schools are better or is it because they draw  from better students? This is a question of cream skimming.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5wiwividUE
Testing for Cream Skimming in India,"It's part of what I looked at in  one of my papers, and it's what we are going to talk  about in this video. Lots of papers have tried to  control for cream skimming using American data or data  from other countries, but they haven't always  convinced the critics. And the reason for this is that when the private schools are  just 10% of the market, the kids in the private schools are in fact very likely to be different than the kids in the public schools. With only 10% of the market, It's easy to imagine that  it's a different 10%, it's the best 10%, or a portion of it it's the best 10% However, India offers a unique opportunity to test for cream skimming, because in many districts in India -- and these are just a few -- a majority of the kids are  in private schools. Well, if the majority of the kids are in the private schools, these kids must be much closer to average, because they're the majority.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5wiwividUE
Testing for Cream Skimming in India,"If the majority of the kids are in the private schools, they can't all be the cream. That's the intuition, let's look in a little more detail at a model. Here's a simple model of cream skimming. We are going to make 3 important assumptions: First, there's some distribution of child ability - some kids have higher ability than do other kids. Second, we're going to assume that private schools offer no  educational advantages.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5wiwividUE
Testing for Cream Skimming in India,"Private schools do not increase ability or testing level anymore  than do public schools. They are equal. Now, given this assumption, the average ability taken over all children, whether they are in public schools or in private schools, will not vary with the private share. Since private schools offer no advantages over public schools, as we increase the private share, the mean over the entire population will be absolutely fixed. Third assumption, we're going to assume that the private schools draw from the top of the public school distribution or draw to a greater extent from the top of the public school distribution.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5wiwividUE
Testing for Cream Skimming in India,"With these assumptions, when the private share is low, it's quite easy for the private mean to be well above the public mean. Simply because private schools draw cream skim from the top of the public distribution. Notice however that as the private share increases, the private mean must fall and get closer and closer to the  population mean. Similarly, since the private schools are drawing from the top of the  public distribution, the public mean must fall lower and lower as the private share increases. Okay, here's a second model of education: The Higher Productivity Model.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5wiwividUE
Testing for Cream Skimming in India,"In this model, we assume that the private schools are better than the public schools. They actually raise educational quality and achievements. We're also going to assume that the private schools pull randomly from the public schools So, there's no cream skimming going on in this model. What this means is that when the private share of education is low, the population mean is close to the the public mean. As the private share increases  however, and as we get more and more kids entering the better schools, you get an increase in the population mean until as you get almost everybody in the private schools, the population mean is equal to  the private mean.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5wiwividUE
Testing for Cream Skimming in India,"Key here is that as you  increase the private share, you get more and more kids in the higher productivity schools so the population mean increases. Okay, what do the data say? Remember, the cream skimming model says that as the private share of schooling increases, you're just changing how the children are distributed,  so there should be no change in the mean score. The higher productivity model says that as the private share increases,  you want to see an increase as you get more and more children into the private sector,  where the educational quality is higher. So what we see for reading scores is that as the private share increases, the mean reading score increases, suggesting higher productivity.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5wiwividUE
Testing for Cream Skimming in India,"Notice, we do not see any  big changes in the scores in the publics schools. We see a slight decline in the scores in the  private schools, suggesting that a little bit of  cream skimming may be going on; nevertheless, we see increases in the mean, which does suggest higher productivity. Now this is just a crude look at the data, let's take a closer look to see if we can pinpoint where cream skimming might be occurring, if it is occurring. In this slide, we're showing  the percentage of children scoring at the highest reading level in the private and in the  public schools. And what is very market here, is that as the private share of schooling increases, from about 0 to say 15%, we see a market decline in the number of children in the private schools scoring at the  highest level.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5wiwividUE
Testing for Cream Skimming in India,"So this suggested that cream skimming is going on. When private share  is really low, When private share is really low, they really are getting the  best of the students. As the private share increases, they are getting lower and lower  quality of students. However, after about 10-15%,  notice that this level's off, and that we see no decline in the private share and also no decline in the public share. So what this suggests is  that there's a little bit of cream skimming going  on, when private schools are small, but when the private schools reach about 20% or so, they are drawing randomly from the population and they have greater achievement.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5wiwividUE
Testing for Cream Skimming in India,"The private schools  actually are increasing educational quality. I think this story makes a lot of sense. When the private schools  are small, of course they draw from the cream, but once the private schools are drawing from over 20% of the population they're basically drawing from the same pool  as are the public schools and what we see is that in the limit there is an improvement  in the reading quality of the kids. Same is also true from mathematics, by the way. So if you go back to the previous video: The Rise of Private Education in India, you'll see that the achievements  level of the kids in private schools are much  higher than those in the public schools.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5wiwividUE
Testing for Cream Skimming in India,"What we've seen now is that some of this difference is due to cream skimming, but a modest, nevertheless, a significant amount is also due to the higher productivity in the private schools. And indeed, that shouldn't be surprising after all the private schools have lower absentee rates. If teachers who are actually in the classroom teaching more often, so it makes sense that there would be some difference. How much is this difference? Well like I said, this difference is modest but significant.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5wiwividUE
Testing for Cream Skimming in India,"So switching children to private schools, would increase by 11.8 percentage points, or 38.5 percent the number of children who can read at the  very highest testing level. Looking at the bottom side, it would decrease, switching kids into the private schools, would decrease by about 5 percentage  points, or 55%, the number of children performing at the lowest tested levels. The same thing is true for arithmetic, look at the paper for details, but basically switching the kids to the private schools would increase by 30% the number of children who can do arithmetic at the highest tested level. And it would decrease by 26% the number of children performing at the lowest arithmetic level. Okay, let's put these results in context The Indian population is very young 370 million people, or 32% of the population below the age of 15 What that means is that there are about 100 million children being education in private schools In fact, this is the largest experiment in private education, probably since 19th  century Great Britain.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5wiwividUE
Testing for Cream Skimming in India,"So how's the experiment going? Well, what my paper suggests, as well as others, is that private schools improve educational performance modestly, but significantly. Even if they don't improve education performance, even if they're just as good as the government schools, they're  considerably cheaper, so that's a big advantage. Despite the fact, or perhaps because of  the fact that this experiment in private education, which happened spontaneously, which happened from the ground up, was NOT driven by government policy was a response of the people, was a response of entrepreneurs and the people for a demand for education despite the fact that this has gone well, the Right to Education Act of 2009 may threaten this experiment. The Right to Education Act imposes conditions on the private schools many of which do not apply to the public schools.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5wiwividUE
Testing for Cream Skimming in India,"We'll have to see what happens in  the future. Here's some further reading. My paper of course, I mentioned James Tooley before and his co-authors and I've also mentioned Nindan Nilekani's  book before. I should also point out that not everybody finds that private education raises achievement levels. There's a  paper by Chudgar and Quin, they find that private and public schools are about  the same, once you control selection factors I actually find this somewhat difficult to believe since we do know that the private schools do have much lower absentee rates the public schools have much higher absentee rates.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5wiwividUE
Testing for Cream Skimming in India,"Nevertheless, they find once you control for other factors, achievement levels are about the same However, the private schools are much  cheaper than the public schools. So when a productivity advantage that would still go to the private schools Kingdon finds, as I do, that the private schools in India have a higher quality and efficiency.

Edward Luce on India,"- [Cowen] Hello, I'm sitting here  with Edward Luce, who's the author of one of my favorite books,  maybe my favorite book, on modern India. So I thought I'd just ask him a few questions about Indian economic prospects. Let's start with a very simple question: Should we be pessimists  about Indian economic prospects, for the short run, medium, or long run? What do you think on that since having written your book? - [Luce] I think, in the short run, I'd share the widespread pessimism that people have.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEEZf0wcnXM
Edward Luce on India,"But it's very very hard to be pessimistic in the medium/long run with India. If you see the demographics of the country, and you assume growth doesn't  completely disappear, that this is there for a positive force, and you look at the demographics of China, it's very hard to imagine India  not powering ahead, having a higher savings rate,  higher working, higher investment rates, therefore, higher growth rates. Catastrophe could upset this, -- but it would have to be  pretty catastrophic. - [Cowen] Thank you. Let me just push  on the case for pessimism for a bit.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEEZf0wcnXM
Edward Luce on India,"You have growing population in South Asia, possibly climate change problems,  agricultural productivity's been slow, and most countries that make big leaps forward, you see it starting first in agriculture, and India doesn't really fit that model. So, basically, how are they going to feed everyone even if you're seeing income gains in a lot of classes of the population? - [Luce] That's a very good question. There's been a lot of talk about the need for another green revolution, another great leap forward, in terms of agricultural productivity. I think though that it's very hard  to see where that's going to come from without some kind of rationalization of land ownership.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEEZf0wcnXM
Edward Luce on India,"You're going to have to allow people  to own larger plots of land. you're going to have to make land ownership easier, title deeds easier. The unique identification authority  of India which is, as you know, issuing a unique  biometric card to everybody, believes that all sorts of -- ownership issues and identity issues can be sorted out  once this system's in place; and there's about another year before it's fully in place; and the people are really underestimating  just how transformative it could be, for example, in the agricultural land market. You've got to hope for that kind  of unexpected change because there's nothing in terms of  the conventional policy approaches from New Delhi to suggest that a big agricultural revolution  is around the corner. - [Cowen] So, if we're looking for two or three variables that people would look at, to try to see how India's doing  in the short and medium run, or news items, or indicators; what is it that people should look at, actually, to get a sense of where India's headed?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEEZf0wcnXM
Edward Luce on India,"- [Luce] One of them, I think,  would be on the political plane, which is looking at the viability of Narendra Modi, the chief minister of Gujarat, because there is  a great deal of exasperation. It's really tangible amongst  the Anglophone middle classes and, of course, way beyond that. But among the elite opinion formers with the low caliber of politicians, of governance in all forms, and there's a great deal of  admiration for almost every aspect of Narendra Modi's administration barring a very very important  elephant in the room -- his communal attitude. I would look at -- relations with Pakistan as a huge and important variable, and this has been underappreciated given Pakistan's behavior more generally. The degree to which it is becoming a responsible neighbor and India has been -- and Manmohan Singh, in particular, has been successful at incentivizing Pakistan to become  a more responsible neighbor.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEEZf0wcnXM
Edward Luce on India,"Trade. You know, access  to the Indian market, trade opening, and so forth. Narendra Modi, of course, wouldn't  necessarily be particularly good for that scenario. And I would look at  the continued rate of -- what some people call ""brain circulation"", but I think it's right to call ""reverse brain drain""; going back to India, which has paused in the last year or two, I understand anecdotally, because growth has slowed considerably. I would look at that as a really good  advance indicator of future Indian growth of short and medium-term  Indian growth prospects.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEEZf0wcnXM
Edward Luce on India,"- [Cowen] I thank you for that. That's Edward Luce  speaking from late 2012. For further reading, I very much recommend his book, ""In Spite of the Gods: The Rise of Modern India"", and for his more recent writings, just google ""edward luce india"", and you'll come up with plenty.

Frugal innovation for the heart,"One especially important  Indian innovation has come in the area of heart surgery and how to run a hospital. The leader here is  an Indian named Devi Shetty who has worked near Bangalore  as both a doctor and an entrepreneur. Shetty ran into the problem  that most Indians actually cannot afford  heart surgery at all. If you look around the broader world,  especially in developing countries, most individuals cannot afford  any major form of surgery at all. So he thought about: ""How can I make heart surgery, and other surgeries in general, cheaper without sacrificing quality""?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqb-rnyS0DM
Frugal innovation for the heart,"Shetty reorganized how hospitals are run based on some fairly  fundamental economics ideas. One of these ideas is economies of scale, namely, that the more times  you do a procedure, the better you get at it, the more cheaply you can  do that procedure, and the more readily  you can monitor quality. So one of Shetty's hospitals,  for instance, has over 1,000 beds mostly devoted to doing  particular kinds of heart surgeries. And in the United States, a comparable hospital might have only 160 beds. Of course, that means  that Shetty's hospital is larger.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqb-rnyS0DM
Frugal innovation for the heart,"A related idea is economies  of specialization. So, it's not just that  the Shetty hospital is larger, it's also that it is  more specialized. A doctor does the same operation  many, many times over, and, again, this allows for lower cost and also higher standards of quality. Sometimes, this has been compared  to the more general notion of assembly line production as  is used to produce automobiles. If you look at a Shetty hospital in India, it is commonly the case that  they can do a heart operation for less than 1/10th the US price  at less than $2,000.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqb-rnyS0DM
Frugal innovation for the heart,"And, of course, that allows them to bring heart surgery to many more Indians. Based on the money they have earned, they have also used this revenue to be able to give a lot of  Indians heart surgery either for free or  at greatly reduced prices. Overall, it is in some ways  hard to compare quality because we have different  groups of patients showing up at these Indian hospitals, but all the available evidence we have suggests that the Shetty hospitals have the same or better fatality rates compared to most other  hospitals around the world. If you sum this all up,  that's a really important innovation. What next?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqb-rnyS0DM
Frugal innovation for the heart,"It now seems that  Shetty is looking to set up a branch of one of his medical centers in the Cayman Islands. The Cayman Islands is about  an hour-long flight from Florida. So, it seems that a lot of Americans could travel to the Cayman Islands to use this hospital. The plan is that prices at this hospital will be less than 1/2 of the prices currently prevailing in the United States. This picture, by the way, is actually a symbol for the Cayman Islands and it is, most appropriately, in the shape of a heart.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqb-rnyS0DM
Frugal innovation for the heart,"To read more about this topic, google Devi Shetty, there's plenty online. You can also watch interviews with him on Youtube.

Think of this word as standing in  for some concept of frugal innovation based on constraints.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqb-rnyS0DM
The value of English,"Learning English is one way to advance one's career prospects. But exactly how much does  fluency in English matter? Let's look at some data from India. Not everyone in India speaks English. In fact, in India there 122 languages spoken by 10 000 people or more.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxcLhhBkgo
The value of English,"As a first language, English comes in 44th, on that list of 122. If you consider English as  a second or third language. According to one study,  about 35% of Indians living in cities speak good English and in rural areas, it's only 14% who speak good English. One study found that Indian males who were fluent in English earned 34% higher wages than Indian males who  are not fluent in English. You might think that English here is  somehow a proxy for better work ethic or perhaps superior native ability.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxcLhhBkgo
The value of English,"But, this study was controlling for performance in school, so at least, though extensively  was controlling for work ethic and native ability. The study also finds higher returns for speaking good English to older men. If you look at men in  the age group of 18 to 35, the wage premium for those individuals speaking good English, is around 11%. If you look at men in  the age group of 36 to 50, the wage premium for those individuals is much higher - it's 49%. What seems to be the case is that,  if you speak English, you get on an better career track that's worth something when you're young, but it's worth much more over time as you progress  through that career track.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxcLhhBkgo
The value of English,"So the returns to being able to speak  English seem to rise with age. By the way, if you're wondering what are the comfortable returns for women of the data set in the paper doesn't allow us to answer that question with comfortable accuracy. The paper also finds there were lower returns to speaking good English in areas where there are already many good English speakers. This is simply an implication of basic economic laws of supply and demand. There's another study which looks at data from discrete educational interventions and this paper find that a 1% decrease in the probability of learning English, lower wages by, on average, 1.6%.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxcLhhBkgo
The value of English,"That's, again, quite a considerable effect. There are significant benefits to fluency in English in the country of India. Speaking English, specially  when women speak English, it also seems to break down the cast system. One study did a comparison of siblings - those who were educated in Marathi, which is the indigenous language in Indian Mumbai. Well, those individuals married outside  their cast at a rate of 9.7%.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxcLhhBkgo
The value of English,"The siblings who were educated in English married outside their cast at a rate of 31.6%, which, of course, is much higher. The most comprehensive study is the first one listed here - ""The Returns to  English-Language Skills in India"". That's where most of the numbers in this presentation come from. On the educational intervention, it was the paper: ""English Language Premium: Evidence  from a Policy Experiment in India"" and finally, on castes, read Munshi and Rosenzweig - ""Traditional Institutions Meet the Modern World"".

Female leadership in India,"[Narrator] Let's look at the issue of how female political leadership really can matter. And note, by the way, this is also a video about crime. It's a common problem in India, and indeed in many countries that large numbers of crimes go unreported. And especially here, I mean crimes against women. These crimes can be as terrible as beatings, rapes, and kidnappings, but one of the problems is that the victimized women don't always trust that the police can do anything to help them out, or to catch or punish the perpetrators.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6GuWaIXDk
Female leadership in India,"So what can be done about this? Well, we have one natural experiment, which shows that roles of political leadership actually may make a big difference for women and improve some of these outcomes. In 1993, India passed a Constitutional Amendment, which changed Indian politics in a number of ways. Most importantly for this discussion, it was mandated that 1/3 of local council slots were to be reserved for women. That, of course, meant many more female leaders at the local level.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6GuWaIXDk
Female leadership in India,"So what's the study? Well, the implementation of this amendment had differential timing across the Indian states, so we can compare the states where the amendment was implemented earlier to the states where the amendment was implemented later, and see what kind of difference it might make to have more women in more roles of local leadership. I find the results of this natural experiment to be quite surprising, and, indeed, sobering. Once there are more women in positions of local political leadership, we find that documented crimes against women go up by about 46%. Documented cases of rape go up by about 23%, and for kidnapping, it's going up by about 17%.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6GuWaIXDk
Female leadership in India,"Keep in mind, this is not suggesting that the number of these crimes committed is going up, but rather, it's that the reporting of the crimes is going up. And this indeed is pretty scary. It's an indication of just how much women in different societies have been unwilling to report crimes against them, and it also suggests there is probably a very large number of crimes against women still going on and still being under-reported. So how do we know that this is mainly a reporting effect? Well, for one thing, during the time period under consideration, there is no comparable increase in reported crimes against men, or for that matter, against general property.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6GuWaIXDk
Female leadership in India,"Furthermore, there is no comparable increase in the reported number of murders of women. Why would you expect a difference between murders and kidnappings and rapes? Well, it's easier to hide or cover up a kidnapping or a rape or a beating, but in the case of a murder, there's a missing body, and so the under-reporting there is much smaller to begin with. It's been suggested that one reason why you might have higher reporting of crimes against women when there are local female political leaders is that to get some kind of justice, or even to have your plea or complaint heard, there will be a lower chance of bribery. It also seems that when there are more local female leaders, there's an expectation of greater police responsiveness.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6GuWaIXDk
Female leadership in India,"In the longer run, of course, that also will deter crimes against women. There's another interesting result from this natural experiment. For the purposes of encouraging reporting of crimes against women, what really seems to matter is political representation of women at lower levels rather than having women in positions of absolute leadership. Perhaps it's the lower-level positions, which are closer to local crime enforcement. To read more on this topic, and also to see exactly how  the empirical work was done, I very much recommend this piece, which is available online.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6GuWaIXDk
Female leadership in India,"Overall, this is a topic which, although the world has shown improvement in critical regards, it shows just how much further we need to come along.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6GuWaIXDk
Cable TV and women,"Now, let's look at how cable TV  can change the perceptions of women and also for women. We all talk about what a big difference  TV has made to our lives, but how much does it really matter  in affecting people's perceptions in, say, rural India? Let's consider data from  the years 2002, 2003, where we have really some quite comprehensive information about 21 Indian villages which  were getting cable TV. By the way, these villages  had non-cable TV before, but it seems that when cable comes, TV viewership goes up a lot. In these cases, on average,  TV viewership nearly doubles, and I suppose that's because people find the programs on cable more interesting, more diverse, and more appealing.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keRCVR64AXU
Cable TV and women,"And of course, what we're going to do  is a comparison of villages that get cable compared to villages that don't. The study will also be trying to adjust for possible differences across the villages which are getting cable and the villages which are not to make sure we have as clean  a comparison as is possible. One result is that exposure to cable TV seems to raise the rate  of female education. Without cable, it's at about 68%. With cable, it's over 71%, and there also seem to be fewer  female dropouts over time.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keRCVR64AXU
Cable TV and women,"When cable arrives in a village,  we notice that fertility falls. We don't know, however, if this is because women or families have better  information about birth control or simply that they're exposed to alternative visions of different lifestyles on TV and maybe want to spend  their time in ways other than just having more children. What are other changes are there? Well, when TV arrives, wife-beating is seen as less justified, and in general, sons are considered  less preferred to daughters than before the arrival of cable TV. If we look at data on the magnitude of these changes, it seems quite significant.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keRCVR64AXU
Cable TV and women,"Here's one way to put it, that if you consider the rural-urban difference in attitudes, that 45% to 70% of that difference  disappears within two years of having cable TV. We also see the largest  change in attitudes in areas which, prior to  the arrival of cable TV, had the worst attitudes towards women. Another way to put the comparison  is that the arrival of cable TV in an Indian rural village seems  to have an effect on attitudes equal to about five extra years  of female education. Again, that seems to be  a significant effect. All of this data and analysis are taken from a very interesting paper by Robert Jensen and Emily Oster called ""The Power of TV: Cable Television  and Women's Status in India"".",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keRCVR64AXU
Cable TV and women,"That paper is available online. I also would mention there are other studies of the influence of television, especially in Africa, and you can find  those citations in their paper, but the results are broadly consistent  with what we've discussed here.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keRCVR64AXU
Partha Dasgupta,"Partha Dasgupta is a very deep  and philosophical economist. He was born in 1942 and he spent much of his career at the University of Cambridge. So what is Dasgupta really about? Much of his work focuses on the philosophical foundations  of welfare economics, that is, comparing one  economic outcome to another. Dasgupta has written essays on what exactly is well-being and how  do we know when people are better off.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzWGjYSKAnI
Partha Dasgupta,"He has numerous essays on what is the best population for a society. If a society gives birth  to more individuals, can we say, in some sense,  that society is better than a society with fewer individuals? He studied how much  we should discount the future, a critical issue for evaluating how much to invest  in protecting the environment. In all of these areas, over decades, Dasgupta has built up a very substantial and very well-respected body of work. Let's look just briefly  at just one of his points with respect to the environment and measurements of well-being.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzWGjYSKAnI
Partha Dasgupta,"Dasgupta likes to stress that  wealth takes many forms and we shouldn't just obsess over GDP. To give a simple example, consider a poor country which  chops down a lot of trees and sells the wood for export. As measured by national  income or GDP statistics, that country is much wealthier. But when you look at the problem more deeply, when you think about sustainability, you see that in some ways  that country is much poorer. So, Dasgupta has argued that  we should revise our GDP statistics to take into account  the depletion of natural resources.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzWGjYSKAnI
Partha Dasgupta,"In practical terms, this means  a new metric for well-being, one that takes into account the environment. At the level of policy, it means we should think more about sustainability. It also means that many poor countries are in fact poorer than we think because they've damaged their environment, they're on non-sustainable growth paths. They're doing a mix of consuming  the wrong things too much, or treating their air supplies,  or water supplies, or forest supplies too badly. An example, of course, would be Haiti, in the Caribbean, a country which has chopped down  nearly all of its natural forestation, due to ill-defined property rights.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzWGjYSKAnI

Jagdish N Bhagwati,"Jagdish Bhagwati was born in 1934 to a Gujarati family in Mumbai. He spent a lot of his career teaching  at MIT and Columbia University. Bhagwati wrote a famous paper  on what he called directly unproductive,  profit-seeking activities or DUP. This is sometimes called rent-seeking behavior by other economists. The point here is simple.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jz_d8xCzqp8
Jagdish N Bhagwati,"Often, individuals invest their resources in trying to take or extract  wealth from others usually through politics rather  than producing or innovating. When this happens, it leads to lower rates of productivity growth in an economy. Bhagwati, along with  Gordon Tullock and Anne Krueger, was one of the first economists  to point out the importance of directly unproductive, profit-seeking activities or again, as it is often called, rent-seeking. For decades, Bhagwati has been a major advocate of free trade and globalization. And, in many ways, he has defended a classically liberal point of view on development economics.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jz_d8xCzqp8
Jagdish N Bhagwati,"Bhagwati has a keen appreciation  of the virtues of markets and he also understands that,  in an open trading economy, the incentives are stronger for  a production and innovation and the incentives are weaker for his directly unproductive, profit-seeking DUP activities. Bhagwati, however, has not been an advocate for free markets in all regards. In the late 1990s, he wrote some pieces arguing that free capital movements were not as good for developing economies as where the free movement of goods. When goods cross borders, what happens is that each economy becomes more productive and living standards go up. Bhagwati worried that  when capital crossed borders, there was the risk that capital would  first flow into a developing economy and then later be pulled out very rapidly leading to a lot of unneeded volatility  and also perhaps some financial crises.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jz_d8xCzqp8
Jagdish N Bhagwati,"This argument was seen as very important during the Asian financial crises of the late 1990s, at the time Bhagwati wrote.

W. Arthur Lewis,"We are gonna talk about W. Arthur Lewis. W. Arthur Lewis was born in 1950  on the Caribbean island of Saint Lucia -- and he passed away in 1991. He taught at LSE,  University of Manchester and Princeton. In addition to his economics writings, he also was head of  University College of the West Indies and he was an important  economic advisor to Ghana. He a very worldly life.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Y7vxRXi354
W. Arthur Lewis,"In 1979, he won the Nobel prize. He is best known for his work  on economic development and the theory of labor markets. In 1954, Lewis published a very famous  article, his most famous contribution. It was called ""Economic Development  with Unlimited Supplies of Labor"". In this article, Lewis sought to overturn previous understanding of how labor markets work in developing nations.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Y7vxRXi354
W. Arthur Lewis,"In his view, there was a large quantity of what he called surplus labor. So, if an economy would grow  in some of its sectors, say, manufacturing or exports that surplus labor would  move in from the countryside and wages would fall again. So his main point was that  the existence of these surplus labor made it very hard  to boost wages in growth sectors and it made economy stay poor  for longer periods of time than we might have expected. So, the older view of labor market  was one where when the demand for labor  went up, wages would go up. In Lewis' view, that doesn't  happen for a long time.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Y7vxRXi354
W. Arthur Lewis,"When the demand for labors goes up, first, you get a large movement of people coming from the countryside and wages don't really go up much at all. Let's just review some of key ideas  in this article and Lewis's work. For Lewis, the key question is: Why are workers in  developing nations still poor after those countries have  been growing for decades? And again, he invoked  this idea of surplus labor, that it's very hard to get  a sustained wage increase because there were so many  poor workers out there in the countryside who would be willing  to migrate to urban areas if the job opportunities were there. Second, Lewis was in some ways skeptical about capital formation.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Y7vxRXi354
W. Arthur Lewis,"He argued that in the short run and maybe even in the medium run, capital formation raises profits but doesn't necessarily raise wages. It helps more people, say, who live  in cities, but wages would be fairly flat. Lewis favored capital formation. He just was somewhat of a pessimist as to how long it will take for capital formation to pay off. He pointed out that wages  are going to rise really only when the pool of surplus labor is more or less exhausted.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Y7vxRXi354
W. Arthur Lewis,"And that could take further decades. So Lewis was trying to explain why the third world,  as it was called in his time, was not seeing a greater boost  in living standard than what he observed. Finally and also controversially, Lewis toyed with arguments for  protectionism rather than free trade. So a standard argument for protectionism is that by protecting domestic industries  against foreign competition you create some jobs for your home market. Free traders counter with a natural argument that foreign supplier could produce those goods and services more efficiently and that it would be better to have free trade, buy those goods and services from abroad and enjoy greater prosperity.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Y7vxRXi354
W. Arthur Lewis,"Lewis argued that if you could artificially create jobs in your domestic market this might look inefficient in the short run but it actually would mean that you would more quickly exhaust  the pool of surplus labor by creating those jobs and you would more quickly get to the point where capital formation would raise not only profits but also wages. Of course, not all of economists have agreed with the models of W. Arthur Lewis but they have indeed revolutionized  development economics, our understanding of labor markets and they have given rise  to many decades of debate.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Y7vxRXi354
Bela Balassa,"Bela Balassa was an important development economist who was born in Hungary in 1928, and who passed away in 1991. He fled Hungary after the 1956 Anti Communist Revolt and moved to the United States. He taught for a long time at Johns Hopkins University, and did a great deal of work for the World Bank. I'm very pleased to have known Bela's wife, Carol Balassa, who is a wonderful companion and who has been a friend of mine. Let's now talk about Bela Balassa's greatest contribution to economic thought.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvZy8wsIz_s
Bela Balassa,"Bela Balassa wanted to explain why services are more expensive in some countries than in other countries. For instance, if you are in Norway, a typical haircut costs about $65, which of course is very expensive. If you are in Mexico, it is not difficult to get a good haircut for $5 or less, which of course is not nearly as expensive. What might account for this difference? This was one of the questions that drove Bela Balassa.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvZy8wsIz_s
Bela Balassa,"He concluded that it had a great deal to do with labor productivity. So labor overall was more productive in Norway than in Mexico in most economic sectors. Norway is a richer Country, that has a higher standard of living. It is better geared up for productive business for export. So imagine that we have barbers in Mexico and barbers in Norway.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvZy8wsIz_s
Bela Balassa,"To get a barber to work in Norway, well that barber or potential barber has the option of earning a lot more money in some other sector, say the oil sector. Whereas, a barber in Mexico doesn't have the same or comparable options to earn a lot of money in other sectors. Cuz the other sectors in Mexico are not nearly as productive. If you look for instance at oil companies in Norway compared to Mexico. In Norway, the sector is more efficient.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvZy8wsIz_s
Bela Balassa,"In Mexico in the oil company, the state company Pemex, there is more political patronage, costs are higher. They're not nearly as good at exploration and discovery, they're not as good at marketing. And that's all an indication of the inefficiency in the Mexican economy. Now how does this all relate back to barbers? When you look at barbers, barbers in Mexico are actually about as productive as barbers in Norway.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvZy8wsIz_s
Bela Balassa,"It's not like working in the oil sector, where Norway is more productive than Mexico. If you go to a barber in Mexico, the basic technology is scissors, comb, and razor. If you go to a barber in Norway, the basic technology is scissors, comb and razor. So there's a productivity equality for the barbers across Norway and Mexico, but in other sectors like oil, there's greater productivity in Norway. That means that the payment for Norwegian barbers has to be higher to get them to do the work of cutting your hair.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvZy8wsIz_s
Bela Balassa,"And it means that if you're a tourist, let's say you're travelling, you're taking a trip to Norway, you're taking a trip to Mexico. In which country should you get your hair cut? Of course, you should get your hair cut in Mexico. Of course, this is not only a story about barbers. It is also a story of personal servants.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvZy8wsIz_s
Bela Balassa,"So, it is common in Mexico for a middle or upper middle class family to employ some number of servants. It is not equally common in Norway for a middle class family to employ servants. Why is that? It's the same reasoning all over again. Norwegian labor is more productive in some sectors.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvZy8wsIz_s
Bela Balassa,"So to hire that labor to work for you as a personal servant or as a barber, it's simply going to cost more money. So there are some sectors, such as barbering or personal servants where the productivity across nations really doesn't vary all that much, because it's the same technology, basically similar production methods. And in those cases, the poorer countries will produce those services much more cheaply than you will find them produced and sold in the wealthier countries such as Norway or the United States. One implication of Balassa's thesis is that a lot of poorer countries may be somewhat wealthier than the published statistic indicate. Why is that?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvZy8wsIz_s
Bela Balassa,"Well, it's the case that in these poorer countries, a lot of services have very low prices. So the standard of living may be somewhat higher than a quick, crude, or naive look at the numbers would indicate. So, just to sum up, what are the lessons behind Balassa's theory about exchange rates and relative prices? One, get your hair cut in poorer countries. Two, if you live in a poorer country, you are more likely to employ personal servants.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvZy8wsIz_s
Bela Balassa,"Three, the theoretical point, there is some sectors where wealthier countries are much more productive and other sectors where the wealthier countries such as Norway really aren't more productive at all such as barbering. Four be very careful about using economic statistics because countries differ in many ways. And in some ways poorer countries have cheaper services for people to be able to afford. BÄÅ la Balassa had other contributions. He wrote a wonderful book on economic integration in Europe.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvZy8wsIz_s
Bela Balassa,"He also was well known for writing actually a dining guide to Paris, which he circulated to many other economists. But this is Belassa's best known contribution. It also comes from some work from other important economists such as Paul Samuelson and Roy Harrod. But, that in a nutshell is why Bella Balassa is an important development economist.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvZy8wsIz_s
Adam Smith,"It usually begins with Adam Smith. Adam Smith published his  The Wealth of Nations in 1776. Back then, all economics was  development economics because all the countries  of the world were poor. This book helped give birth to  economics as a modern science, but it's still the most important book on development economics,  which has been written. It's hard to get a handle on Smith's book  because it's so wide-ranging, and so much of the economics we know  has come from that book, either directly or indirectly.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DVBV3Ef_io
Adam Smith,"So rather than try to cover  everything, which is in there, which would take a course of its own,  let's look at just a few highlights. The best way to learn about Adam Smith  is to read some Adam Smith. Fortunately, The Wealth of Nations is online for free, and you can google to it every easily. If you're interested in  development economics, there are three sections  in particular I think you should read. The first of those is Book I, Chapter I  ""Of the Division of Labor"".",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DVBV3Ef_io
Adam Smith,"This is Smith's famous discussion of  the pin factory, and he puts forward his well-known maxim: division of labor  is limited by the extent of the market. As the size of a market grows larger,  individuals can specialize more. They become more productive. Production becomes more diverse. And this increase in productiviety spurs  economic growth, which, in turn, makes the size of the market yet bigger,  which, in turn, leads to further division of labor and specialization.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DVBV3Ef_io
Adam Smith,"This is a key idea behind a lot of  modern theories of development, including increasing returns to scale  and the big push. The second section I would like  to recommend is titled ""How the Commerce of the  Towns Contributed to the Improvement of the Country""  Book III, Chapter IV. If you read that chapter of Smith,  and then you read modern development economics, say,  circa 1950-1960, it's striking actually how much more advanced and  sophisticated Smith's discussion is. The profession in, say, 1960  was still struggling to catch up to the insights embedded in  The Wealth of Nations. Perhaps my favorite section in  The Wealth of Nations is Book IV, Chapter V, part II.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DVBV3Ef_io
Adam Smith,"That's called ""Digression Concerning  the Corn Trade and Corn Laws,"" and this is all about the price system. It's about how prices allocate resources. It's about how prices limit famine. It's about how speculators encourage  corn and food, more generally, to be allocated to the  times of the greatest need. It's probably the most important  and most seminal description of the price system that  any economist has written.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DVBV3Ef_io
Adam Smith,"When Alex and I wrote ""a price is  a signal wrapped up in an incentive"" in our principles text,  we were really drawing upon this section from Adam Smith. Do go read those sections,  but there's really much, much more in the book. There's a wonderful discussion of  how wages are determined by productivity, of how nutrition is an investment  in human capital, of capital accumulation and how capital accumulation  bids up wages. Smith pioneered the idea of  rent-seeking behavior. In this context, the notion that  businessmen go to government to get monopoly privileges.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DVBV3Ef_io
Adam Smith,"Smith understood that exports per se  are not the source of wealth, that importing more money  or specie into a country, as mercantilism has suggested,  is not a source of wealth. The book is remarkable for  how much time it devotes to China; India; and the New World,  all, of course, back in the 18th century. Smith had a marvelous analysis  of public debt. He understood quite well  the notion of public goods, the effects of taxation on  economic growth; the importance of urbanization;  the benefits of trade; the value of infrastracture --  in his case, roads, turnpikes, and canals -- for a growing economy;  the possible costs of civil conflict on economic growth;  the relevance of education, once again, headed back to human capital. And, overall, he had a wise,  pragmatic perspective on a wide array of economic issues,  in each case, really looking at the evidence and the theory  taken together to see when the sphere of the market  was appropriate and when government intervention might be wiser.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DVBV3Ef_io
Adam Smith,"Overall, what's so wonderful about  Smith's book is not just its coverage of all these topics but his vision of  how they added up to an integrated hall, which became economics and  also development economics, and the way in which he analyzes  economic issues on a variety of different levels, so the balance between  history and theory in the book, the balance between the general statement  and the particular statement overall show a fantastic wisdom,  which, to this day, I think economists are still  struggling to reattain. So if you're going to read only  a few economics books in your lifetime, Smith should be one of them,  and I recommend that you start with the sections outlined in this video.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DVBV3Ef_io
Joseph Schumpeter,"Joseph Schumpeter was born in  the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1883 and he passed away in  the United States in 1950. He's generally considered to have been one of the greatest economists of the first half of the 20th century. We'll look just ever so briefly at some of his contributions to development economics. Schumpeter, by the way, spent the first part of his career teaching in Central Europe, he had a brief stint at  the Ministry of Finance in Austria, and he also worked in the private sector. The second half of his career,  he taught at Harvard University.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzUn627cmwI
Joseph Schumpeter,"Early in the 20th century,  Schumpeter wrote a famous book, ""Theory of Economic Development"". And in this book, he put forward  the notion of the entrepreneur as a creative force driving  economic development. The entrepreneur comes up with new ideas, implements those ideas, and sweeps away the older economic order bringing some new set of beneficial changes. By now, this idea is pretty standard fare, but Schumpeter deserves a lot of the credit for showing people how important it was. Schumpeter also coined the phrase ""Creative destruction"".",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzUn627cmwI
Joseph Schumpeter,"By this, he meant that economic creation and economic destruction were two sides of the same coin. So if, an economy was to be growing, that would also mean that a lot of sectors would be closing up shop, there would be a lot of business bankruptcies, there would be a lot of business losses. And Schumpeter understood this process of one as being inevitable  in a growing economy whereby new ideas must mean  that older ideas are falling away. Schumpeter very frequently  emphasized the notion that growth is a process of  disequilibrium and change. Schumpeter also wrote a very nice book called ""Imperialism and Social Classes"".",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzUn627cmwI
Joseph Schumpeter,"I read this book as a kind of  response to Lenin, who suggested that imperialism  was the highest stage of capitalism. Schumpeter had a very different perspective. He saw imperialism as coming from  earlier rooted forces such as nationalism and militarism. And for Schumpeter, imperialism was something quite backward and atavistic, and he identified capitalism  instead with free trade and peace. There's much more to Schumpeter than this, but he has proven one of the most seminal thinkers for development economics.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzUn627cmwI
Alexander Gerschenkron,"Alexander Gerschenkron was born  in Odessa in 1904 and he died in 1978. In 1920, he fled the Soviet Union. For a while, he studied with the Austrians at the University of Vienna and he ended up spending most of  his career teaching at Harvard University. He was more an economic historian  than a development economist per se, but he has been one of the most influential thinkers on economic development. In 1951, he published a very famous essay ""Economic Backwardness in Historical Perspective"" and he later had a book by the same title.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3zAo9KgSqA
Alexander Gerschenkron,"In this essay, Gerschenkron puts  forward a very sophisticated, very historically informed view of growth. In his view, growth is not linear, but rather, it precedes by big leaps. A backward country does not do best by emphasizing agriculture, but rather, they're most likely  to succeed in manufacturing, especially to do well in an area  where ideas and technologies and production processes  are advancing rapidly. So, to give an example, the Japanese growth after  World War 2 was very much boosted by automobile production. The automobile was not invented by Japan but the Japanese used technology transfer, and did the manufacturing  and the quality control just one step better, and this was a big driver of Japanese growth.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3zAo9KgSqA
Alexander Gerschenkron,"They probably did better this way  than if they had tried to copy older, backward, or more stagnant sectors. So, in his view, technology transfer is important but a backward or developing economy can, in fact, do it better and that's their best hope; to try to make that big leap with growth in advancing sectors. In the world that Gerschenkron grew up in, economic growth often looked a bit like this. He also argued that social norms  toward entrepreneurs and innovation were very important. The norms should be pro-entrepreneurship.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3zAo9KgSqA
Alexander Gerschenkron,"He worried a lot of that built up social tensions in backward economies. Russia and the Soviet Union is  one reason why this is the case, because, of course, the Russian backwardness gave rise to the Bolshevik revolution. He also understood that, in backward economies, rather than viewing them as full of surplus or extra labor, that actual useful labor with  the proper skills can be quite scarce. In general, he was sympathetic to government investment and spending, and he also believed that,  especially backward economies, had all the more reason to require  government intervention, again, for the prospect of making these significant leaps forward. He also wrote a famous paper in 1947 arguing that Soviet growth rates  were being calculated incorrectly.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3zAo9KgSqA
Alexander Gerschenkron,"This was a matter of using  the false technique and he showed what was the right way to calculate these growth rates, and that would imply the soviets were not growing as rapidly as they had been claiming. In general, a lot of his writings  can be viewed as either anti-Marxist or reaction to Marxism. The Marxist view was that economic growth was a series of progressions through regular predictable stages, whereas Gerschenkron was saying that economies can make big leaps and skip some of these stages. Just to show his breath,  he also wrote some essays on the economic lessons  embedded in Soviet novels. Gerschenkron was renowned as  a sophisticated and deep thinker, as a scholar, and he was well known for the large number of excellent students he produced in economic history.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3zAo9KgSqA
Alexander Gerschenkron,"And that, in a nutshell, are some reasons why Alexander Gerschenkron has been one of the most important thinkers  in development economics.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3zAo9KgSqA
Karl Polanyi,"Karl Polanyi was born in 1886 in Vienna and he passed away in 1964. He's not an economist  in the traditional sense, but his book The Great Transformation has had a lot of influence on economic thinking. Polanyi was himself a mix of a philosopher, a historian, an economic historian, and an anthropologist. What he did in this book,  The Great Transformation, is provide a general framework for thinking about the decline of classical liberal thought, and the decline of laissez-faire capitalism from the 19th century. Polanyi starts the book with a very dramatic sentence, ""19th century civilization has collapsed"".",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4L44CBN4uE
Karl Polanyi,"By 19th century civilization, he was referring to Europe, and he had in mind  four particular components: The balance of power system between competing nation states, the gold standard, the idea of self-regulating markets, and the notion of the liberal night-watchman state, which protected property rights but otherwise would let a kind of capitalism run its course. This book was published in 1944, so perhaps it's not surprising  that it's so pessimistic about the course of European history. But Polanyi saw pretty clearly that some previous world order really had passed on and probably was not going  to return anytime soon. What were, for Polanyi, the culprits? Well, The Great Transformation is a very complex book.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4L44CBN4uE
Karl Polanyi,"It has in it a lot of history,  and also a lot about foreign policy. But let's consider just three of Polanyi's culprits. The first is risk. The notion that in a self-regulating market economy, individuals are exposed to too much risk on their wages, on their capital returns, on their rents, on their business prospects. Polanyi saw a self-regulating market as bringing too much risk upon most individuals in a society.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4L44CBN4uE
Karl Polanyi,"The second culprit  can be seen as deflation. Polanyi understood that the gold standard knit together most of Europe in a network of  self-regulating trade relations, and a self-regulating monetary order. It prevented rampant inflation. But at the same time,  under the gold standard, there were periodic financial crises, credit would collapse, money supplies would fall, economic activity would slow, and there would be deflationary  pressures on economies. These deflationary pressures were also a source of risk, and furthermore, they tended to make politics in the deflationary economies more brutal, or more oppressive, or more liberal.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4L44CBN4uE
Karl Polanyi,"The third culprit, which Polanyi  wrote about, among others, is this idea that a self-regulating market annihilates its underlying social context. Part of Polanyi's other works were written from an anthropological point of view, and he claimed that the market was a relatively recent human invention, and that before markets were so prominent in human affairs, that social orders had their own regulating principles which were quite distinct from those of market economies. By no means do all historians and anthropologists agree with this point of view. But to return to Polanyi's perspective, he saw this underlying social context as important as helping to give rise to a market order, to a liberal trading order, but that the market itself would become so rampant, and so commodified, and so, commercialize human activity, that eventually the self-regulating market would do away, or weaken, this underlying social context. And thus, their would be a kind of cultural contradiction to capitalism, and an economic contradiction to laissez-faire capitalism, arising from excess risk,  deflationary pressures, and this annihilation of the underlying social context.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4L44CBN4uE
Karl Polanyi,"It's a very complex, nuanced historical argument, but those are just some  of it's main features. Polanyi was mostly a diagnostician, and he was not, in this book, concerned with producing proposals for concrete reform. He simply wanted to understand why European history had taken the course that it had. And he saw the sage of laissez-faire capitalism as very much over. Polanyi has proved an extremely influential thinker.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4L44CBN4uE
Karl Polanyi,"Perhaps his book The Great Transformation can be compared to a book by Friedrich A. Hayek, Road to Serfdom, published around the same time. Individuals from conservative and libertarian points of view have looked to Hayek's work  as a kind of patron saint, a kind of explanation for what went wrong. And individuals from left-wing, progressive, or social democratic point of views have read Polanyi's work along the same lines, as a kind of overall treatise or tract on where we came from. A key question looking forward which, of course, is still debated, is what about our New World Order? Have we overcome the mechanisms of instability identified by Polanyi by having these social democratic welfare states?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4L44CBN4uE
Karl Polanyi,"Or have we just, in some way, rebuilt the Old World Order on somewhat new principles. But perhaps a New World Order  also has some cultural and economic self-contradictions, and that may disappear as well. This debate continues to go on, but one thing seems pretty sure, Polanyi's influence has risen, and The Great Transformation, for all of it's controversy, is still a book which people read.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4L44CBN4uE
Edward Banfield,"Edward Banfield was  an American political scientist but he's had a strong influence  on development economics. He was born in 1915  and passed away in 1999, and he spent most of his career at the University of Chicago and Harvard. in 1958 he published  a famous study of Sicily, one Sicilian town in particular  called Montegrano, and the book was about why Sicily  had remained so poor because, at that time and  still to some extent today, Sicily was one of the very  poorest parts of Western Europe. Banfield saw that the fundamental  problems were those of culture. The book was titled  The Moral Basis of a Backward Society, and for Banfield, the key plague in Sicily was what he called amoral familism.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAVeRDEdQVA
Edward Banfield,"He defined this hypothesis  in the following way, ""Maximize the material short-run  advantage of the nuclear family, assume that all others will do likewise,"" and Banfield noted early in the book that, in Montegrano, there simply were no voluntary charities. In Banfield's view, it was this cultural attitude which kept Sicily poor and which was responsible for poverty in many different parts of the world. Let's now look in a little more detail at some of the key propositions behind this cultural propensity toward amoral familism. Banfield offered a number  of cultural descriptions. For instance, he said that  in a society of amoral familists, only officials will concern  themselves with public affairs, that is, individuals would not be  very public-spirited but officials were paid  to look after public affairs.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAVeRDEdQVA
Edward Banfield,"For a private citizen to take  a serious interest in a public problem will be regarded by the community  as being abnormal or maybe even improper. Precisely because of this lack of  community involvement in a society of amoral familist, there are few checks  on the power of public officials. Officeholders in general do not identify with the missions or the purposes of their organizations. Sometimes they are corrupt,  sometimes they are lazy, but in general they lack  the sense of mission or calling which would otherwise get them to do a very good job. The law is viewed as corrupt and when people see no good  reason to follow the law, they simply won't and they won't  even feel guilty about this.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAVeRDEdQVA
Edward Banfield,"Banfield also wrote and here I quote, ""In a society of amoral familists, the weak will favor regime which  will maintain order with a strong hand"". In part that's because a lot of  the other sources of social order, such as the propensity to cooperate  or public-spiritedness are simply very weak. And if anyone claims to be motivated by public-spiritedness, they'll be viewed as  a kind of liar or fraud. There won't really be leaders and  in a society of amoral familists, abstract political principles simply  won't have that much influence. There will be plenty of zero-sum or negative-sum thinking, and there will be very  low levels of trust.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAVeRDEdQVA
Edward Banfield,Banfield's descriptions of  some of the cultural problems of some poorer societies  resonates to this very day.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAVeRDEdQVA
Paul Krugman,Paul Krugman isn't typically thought of as a development economist in the narrow sense but his work has had a big impact on how people think about economic development so we're not going to give you an overview of Krugman's entire career either as an academic or writing for the New York Times but we look just at a few of his ideas which relate to economic development one of Krugman's core economic ideas is the notion that specialization is an important mode of for trade and in particular international trade the more dominant theory of comparative advantage which we cover in another video unit under that title stress is the idea that in relative terms one person may be more productive at doing something than another person and therefore the two parties should do different things in trade that's all fine and well but specialization is a somewhat different motivation for trade that is even if two people at first were equally productive in all endeavors if the two would specialize overtime each would become more productive doing something and it would then make sense for them to specialize and trade of all varieties on international trade Krugman is probably the one who gives the clearest and most insightful explanation of how the specialization motive for trade differs from the comparative advantage motive for trade Krugman also has written a great deal about increasing returns and this notion of increasing returns holds in a number of contexts for instance a firm may become more productive as it becomes larger and that means that larger markets will tend to support the most productive firms but also there can be increasing returns from clustering a lot of economic activity in a given region for instance that region might be a city Krugman in general has done a lot to refocus the attention of economists on economic geography and the importance of place and that also means the importance of the economic role of cities because cities can lead to increasing returns to scale and they can encourage economic specialization and make individuals more productive so if we're asking big-picture questions about how do these features fit together like where you put economic activity what's the importance of a city what happens to productivity as firms cluster and their activities scale up in terms of size and how does this affect specialization will Krugman is the writer who probably has done the most to tie together these different ideas in an appealing and accessible framework in terms of concrete economic issues Krugman offered a very early and very clear discussion of how a governmental trade policy can improve welfare think back to this notion of increasing returns to scale some firms become much more productive as they operate with a larger number of units being produced a classic example given by Krugman would be bowing and Airbus the world's two leading makers of large planes they're each very productive but they become productive by making a large number of planes based on some kind of fixed base of capacity for output and a company that tried to be as productive but making say only a few planes per year couldn't possibly succeed so we know there'll be a small number of firms making planes if you have a lot of experience making a lot of planes you will be more productive and that then at least potentially gives rise to the notion that if there's some kind of government policy that encourages the making of planes in your region and if your region has the potential to succeed at making those planes well this can make your country wealthier by giving you a kind of first mover advantage and helping you take advantage of those economies of scale for making a lot of different planes at a high level of output Krugman himself always stressed however that although this was a theoretical argument for wide government intervention might improve domestic welfare that he thought in practice free trade was generally the best idea that the notion that governments might get strategic trade policy wrong because of bad information or because of the influence of special interest groups and corruption or simply the notion that if one government starts strategic trade policy and other government will retaliate and for all of those reasons Krugman gave both a good theoretical argument for why strategic trade policy might work but also very good practical arguments why in the actual real world we are usually ill-advised to attempt strategic trade policy when it comes to economic geography Krugman wrote a seminal piece on why it is that manufacturing firms tend to cluster near high demand and why those clusters of manufacturing firms over time tend to develop high productivity if you're analyzing an issue like well why is so much economic activity shifting to China and East Asia Krugman's work in this area is considered quite important in the 1990s Krugman was known as being somewhat of a skeptic about the so-called Asian economic miracle Krugman pointed out also in his popular writings that some of the Asian economic miracle that just came from accumulating a lot of factors and throwing a lot of labor at the problem and having a lot of labor migrating from rural areas to cities so Krugman looking forward wondered how well the Asian economic miracle would hold up and Krugman also was an important analyst of the Asian currency crises of the late 1990s Krugman has some very well-known writings on the idea of debt forgiveness and optimal debt policies toward nations would show money one of the ideas which Krugman put forward is that sometimes a creditor is better off with some debt forgiveness that is asking for less rather than more that if someone is really underwater when it comes to their debt and the creditor asks for the whole thing back well the country or the firm or the individual underwater doesn't really have the incentive to take activities that would increase more value because that individual firm or country knows that entire value is going all to the creditor so sometimes less is more and Krugman put forward this argument for partial debt forgiveness Krugman also has important papers on exchange rate volatility and currency crises those are not central topics in this course but you can google to them and read them part of Krugman's analysis was the first systematic contemporary attempt to figure out how it is that currency crises happen and how it is that a country can have a currency crisis based not just on fundamentals but in part a currency crisis as a self-fulfilling prophecy there's so much on Paul Krugman and by Paul Krugman it's hard to know where to start but here are some very important tips the first is that a lot of poke rudiments later writings they concern politics and they're very controversial a lot of people really like them a lot and a lot of people really don't like them at all and the important thing is to put those feelings and disputes aside and focus on krugman substantive contributions to economics but part of the problem is there's so much on Krugman and Google it can be hard to kind of cut through that mess and get to the best stuff if you'd like to read about Krugman's contributions to international trade theory I very much recommend an essay by Avinash Dixit and Google Avinash Dixit and honor of Paul Krugman that's really a great piece also Paul and troughs and Nathan none have done up some slides on topics and international trade and they cover Krugman's work and how it relates to earlier ideas and those are excellent and very clear and they give you a very good sense of what Krugman has done in international trade theory also you can enter Paul Krugman in scholar.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCzP-WW8SOU
Partha Dasgupta,"Partha Dasgupta is a very deep  and philosophical economist. He was born in 1942, and he spent much of his career at the University of Cambridge. So what is Dasgupta really about? Much of his work focuses on the philosophical foundations  of welfare economics, that is, comparing one economic outcome to another. Dasgupta has written essays on what exactly is well-being and how do we know when people are better off.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtPXQyi7tM0
Partha Dasgupta,"He has numerous essays on what is the best population for a society. If a society gives birth  to more individuals, can we say, in some sense,  that society is better than a society with fewer individuals? He studied how much  we should discount the future, a critical issue for evaluating how much to invest  in protecting the environment. In all of these areas, over decades, Dasgupta has built up a very substantial and very well-respected body of work. Let's look just briefly  at just one of his points with respect to the environment and measurements of well-being.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtPXQyi7tM0
Partha Dasgupta,"Dasgupta likes to stress that  wealth takes many forms and we shouldn't just obsess over GDP. To give a simple example, consider a poor country which chops down a lot of trees and sells the wood for export. As measured by national  income or GDP statistics, that country is much wealthier. But when you look at the problem more deeply, when you think about sustainability, you see that, in some ways, that country is much poorer. So Dasgupta has argued that  we should revise our GDP statistics to take into account  the depletion of natural resources.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtPXQyi7tM0
Partha Dasgupta,"In practical terms, this means  a new metric for well-being, one that takes into account the environment. At the level of policy, it means we should think more about sustainability. It also means that many poor countries are in fact poorer than we think because they've damaged their environment, they're on non-sustainable growth paths, they're doing a mix of consuming  the wrong things too much, or treating their air supplies  or water supplies or forest supplies too badly. An example, of course, would be Haiti, in the Caribbean, a country which has chopped down  nearly all of its natural forestation due to ill-defined property rights. When it comes to asking deep questions about the environment, economic development, and what it means for an economy or a set of people to be better off, Partha Dasgupta is out there in the lead.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtPXQyi7tM0
Paul Romer,"Today, we're going to be  talking about Paul Romer. Paul Romer taught for a long time at Stanford University. More recently, he moved to New York University. And he's most famous for being one of the architects of new growth theory, though, more recently,  he's becoming famous for his work in development economics, in fact, for his entrepreneurship  in development economics. More on that soon.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0AqbVVODFw
Paul Romer,"Romer's most famous paper is called ""Endogenous Technical Change"". This is a monumental paper,  a foundational paper in new growth theory, and it has led to a huge outpouring of work in growth theory. We'll be able to discuss the paper in much detail, but let me just give you an essence of where it came from. Let's remember the Solow model. In the Solow model, output is a function of A as ideas, and a combination of capital and labor.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0AqbVVODFw
Paul Romer,"Now, Solow made two assumptions about ideas, A. First, ideas were a public good. They were freely available  to anyone in the world. Second, -- the growth in ideas was exogenous, that is, outside the model. Ideas just kind of accumulated over time. Now, -- in some ways, this was not such a terrible assumption, particularly the first part.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0AqbVVODFw
Paul Romer,"So, a lot of ideas are public good. So, for example, a force is equal to mass times acceleration, the Pythagorean theorem, These are public goods  available to everyone. However, the second assumption is really problematic, -- because growth is about new ideas. And if you look around in the world, most research and development is produced by for-profit firms. Growth ideas are not  coming out of the ether, they're not just arriving magically, they happen in some places  and not in other places, and they happen for a reason.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0AqbVVODFw
Paul Romer,"They happen because, most of the time,  someone is out to make a profit. In developed economies, 60% to 80% of research and development is privately produced by for-profit firms. Now, Solow, however, made  these assumptions for a reason. He made these assumptions because  they made the model much much simpler, because, with these assumptions,  ideas are freely available, they're literally free,  they're not priced. That means that capital and labor  can be sold in competitive markets; they can each receive  their marginal product.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0AqbVVODFw
Paul Romer,"The product itself can be sold  in competitive markets, and the payments to capital and labor will nicely sum up to exactly  equal the price of the product. So everything works out beautifully  with competitive firms when ideas are not priced. However, -- when ideas are priced,  we have a problem. Let's take a look. Ideas are non-rivalrous, and they cannot be sold  in competitive markets because the marginal cost is zero.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0AqbVVODFw
Paul Romer,"So the classic example here  is the pharmaceutical. The first pill costs a billion dollars. The second pill costs 50 cents. That 50 cents that can be produced, the 2nd pill, and the 3rd, and the 4th, and the 5th, -- and the nth pill can be produced  in competitive markets. The 50 cents comes from  payments to capital and labor, which are just enough to cover  the 50 cents cost of the product.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0AqbVVODFw
Paul Romer,"But, -- that doesn't leave anything over for producing the formula, for producing the idea which made -- the pharmaceutical possible  in the first place. So you can't sell pharmaceuticals  in competitive markets, -- because that doesn't leave enough left over to fund the research and development which went into producing the product in the first place. There has to be some monopoly power. Either the monopoly power  maybe comes from a patent, or maybe it comes from  being first to market, or having a trade secret,  or having some knowledge, or being able to do things better than other people do. But you need some monopoly power -- to fund these ideas.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0AqbVVODFw
Paul Romer,"Ideas also create spillovers,  even when you have monopoly power. Well, the patent runs out over time. The idea itself can be copied  not directly but can be -- the idea can still be useful  and still spread around the world. So what did Romer do? But what Romer did is he created  a model of growth based on ideas which were privately produced  by for-profit firms in monopolistically competitive  markets with spillovers.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0AqbVVODFw
Paul Romer,"Now, -- in one way, that's just  following the formula, that's just doing exactly what  we would hope a model should do. But bear in mind that everyone knew  this was kind of the right way to go. Everyone knew this was the right model. But Arrow failed to create this model, Samuelson failed to create this model, Solow failed to create this model. It wasn't until Romer,  that all the knots were tied, that we had all of these characteristics, which we know are true, that ideas are produced  by monopolistic firms, that ideas are really important in growth.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0AqbVVODFw
Paul Romer,"Ideas have spillovers. All of these ideas combined in a model; that was really Romer's, a supreme accomplishment,  in this paper of 1990. Now, I said the model was  a real technical achievement. That's true, -- but the really important aspect is that economists often don't start to think about things until we have a model. And what Romer did is he put ideas  at the heart of growth theory.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0AqbVVODFw
Paul Romer,"And once you do that, you start to open up and start thinking  about a lot of new things. Like in the Solow model, it's all about  the accumulation of capital. Once you have ideas  at the heart of the model, you start thinking about things like patents and intellectual property. You start thinking about universities, about capital markets  like venture capitalists and having a capital market,  strong capital market, so that entrepreneurs can take their firms public. You start thinking about human capital, and why we might not have  enough human capital in research, why research might be underfunded, because we get spillovers,  because that's a monopolistic industry.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0AqbVVODFw
Paul Romer,"You start asking yourselves questions about: why do some ideas, how do ideas transmit  themselves across the world? How do they flow across the world? Where do ideas begin? Why does it take some ideas  a long time to transmit and other ideas move across  the world quite quickly? You get a whole new perspective on trade, and the importance of market size as generating the incentives to produce R&D.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0AqbVVODFw
Paul Romer,"You begin to think about differences  in types of ideas like technologies. These seem much more amenable  to be communicated across -- different countries than do rules. Rules, by rules I mean things like: how do people interact? Rules about -- rules like how to create a corporation, how to create honest government. Rules like -- democracy, the rule of law, honest judges, judges separated from politicians, a separation of powers.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0AqbVVODFw
Paul Romer,"Much harder to transmit these ideas  and have these ideas adopted than it is to have ideas about, -- you know, how to create  an engine, for example. You also begin to think about  where ideas are created and what is necessary to create new ideas. You think about cities, -- you think about density, of getting people close together  to transmit knowledge. You think about networks. So all of these ideas about ideas  were introduced -- by the Romer model and put at the center of growth theory by Paul Romer.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0AqbVVODFw
Paul Romer,"So in the late 1980s, Romer had produced a number  of papers in new growth theory, culminating in this great 1990 paper. Many people thought he was  on the track for a Nobel Prize, which he may yet win deservedly in my view. And then something strange happened. Romer disappeared, -- or at least it seemed that way to many people in the economics profession. Romer actually gave up tenure.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0AqbVVODFw
Paul Romer,"He gave up tenure at Stanford. He took an extended  five-year leave of absence from Stanford. To do what? Well, Romer created a startup. He created Aplia -- which, long before it became  the buzzword that it is now, Aplia was the beginnings  of online education.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0AqbVVODFw
Paul Romer,"Aplia was a homework solution. Professors could assign quizzes, could grade all their homework online, could do experiments online in economics. They could shift the demand curve. Students could shift demand curves and supply curves. It was a fantastic, fantastic device, -- and very successful.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0AqbVVODFw
Paul Romer,"Romer ran Aplia for about seven years and then sold it for  a lot of money to Cengage. Aplia is still going strong today. So, did Romer leave new growth theory? Or did he take the lessons  of new growth theory, the importance of ideas, the importance of ideas  to create new ideas, to increase productivity, and did he apply those lessons  to a great startup? I think the latter.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0AqbVVODFw
Paul Romer,"And Romer's story has not yet ended. Most recently, Romer has come up  with a startling new idea for development, charter cities. What is this? Well, let's go back to the problem. The problem is the iron rule of rules.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0AqbVVODFw
Paul Romer,"What I mean by this is  that we saw that some rules, things like the rule of law, things like anti-corruption, things like honesty in government. These types of rules are hard  to transmit. Now, why are they hard to transmit? Well, they may be hard to transmit  because they require a lot of interaction and a lot of coordination. It's kind of like getting everyone from driving on  the left-hand side of the road to switch to driving on the right-hand side of the road.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0AqbVVODFw
Paul Romer,"Everyone must agree to coordinate on the new equilibrium, and that's really hard. There may be forces. You can't you do it, you know,  halfway, in halfway steps, you can't do it a little bit at a time. You've got to go all the way or nothing, and that is very, very difficult. Sweden, by the way, actually  managed to do this in the 1970s.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0AqbVVODFw
Paul Romer,"So in just the same way that  it's hard to get people to coordinate on switching from the right-hand side  to the left-hand side or vice-versa, it may be hard to get people  to coordinate out of the corruption trap. Once you become known, once the rules of helping out your cousin, of helping out your tribe member. Once that rule becomes laid down, a single person breaking from that rule -- is gonna have a really hard time. they're gonna be squashed right back down again. If you don't help out your cousin,  you're gonna be thrown out of the family.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0AqbVVODFw
Paul Romer,"It's really hard to break out  of these coordination traps. So how do you do it? Well, the solution is startups -- or a big push in ideas. This is like the big push idea coming  back to us again, but now it's in ideas. What do I mean exactly?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0AqbVVODFw
Paul Romer,"Well, what I mean and what Romer means is to start up a new city, a new city on unoccupied land, with a charter of new rules. What does he have in mind  for these new rules? Well, he wants the rules to come from outside to launch this new equilibrium. So, for example, you take an unoccupied piece of land in a developed country, and you would turn  that unoccupied piece of land over -- to Canada, over to Great Britain, and have them apply this new set of rules, and then have people  voluntarily enter the city, voluntarily put themselves  under the new set of rules. Hong Kong here is the classic example.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0AqbVVODFw
Paul Romer,"Remember it was Hong Kong, -- which has actually completely  revolutionized China. And that's what Romer is hoping. Start up a new city, create it not only as an end in itself  but as a demonstration project. New city of 10 million people or so  operating under completely new rules. New rules which have been  successful elsewhere, bring them to the new city.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0AqbVVODFw
Paul Romer,"Now, Romer introduced this idea  only in 2010 or so; it's very recent. And yet, incredibly, he's already had some success  in pushing the idea -- around the world. So Honduras, for example,  has indicated that it will create, in fact, has created  this unoccupied piece of land where these new rules  could be put in place. Right now, -- Romer is looking for a third party  to come in and help run the new city. Canada is one possibility.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0AqbVVODFw
Paul Romer,"He's got the judges from outside, also being willing to come in  and apply the new rules. Now bear in mind here; something really important; and that is that the world  is urbanizing at a really fast rate. So take India, for example, it's got 800 million people or so  still living a rural existence. But it's clear,  over the next 20 to 30 years, hundreds of millions of these people  are going to be coming to cities, many of them new cities. So now is a great opportunity -- to create fresh new cities.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0AqbVVODFw
Paul Romer,"Cities not beholden to the old rules. Cities, for example, where caste  would no longer be recognized. That, at least is the hope. Will Romer be successful? Who knows.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0AqbVVODFw
Paul Romer,"But it's a bold idea. He has revolutionized economics education, he revolutionized new growth theory. Perhaps this idea is going to take off as well. Here's a couple of places you can  find out more about Paul Romer, particularly about  this new idea of charter cities. Russ Roberts has an excellent interview at EconTalk.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0AqbVVODFw
Paul Romer,"You can also look at Romer's TED talk. I want to also close with the following. You know, I see Paul Romer  is a lot like Coase, and that Coase didn't write very much. He produced only a handful of papers. But those papers were  absolutely revolutionary, and Romer is the same way.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0AqbVVODFw
Paul Romer,"He hasn't written a lot, but what he has written has been very deep, has been very fundamental, has been much more important -- than most other work which goes on in economics. Indeed, when I think about the economists  which have most influenced me, when I think about the ideas which  I think about most on an everyday basis, which I use to interpret the world, -- ideas which I use to interpret the world, a lot of them about growth theory,  about the importance of ideas, about trade, about markets, they're coming from Paul Romer. So indeed, if you want  to take a look at my TED talk, Tabarrok's TED talk, you'll see that that's really an introduction to the ideas of Paul Romer in many ways. So, thanks very much.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0AqbVVODFw
Robert Townsend,"The work of Robert Townsend  has helped us better understand how it is that poorer people  in developing economies insure themselves and each other. Townsend has spent a lot of his career  at University of Chicago and MIT. Townsend's early work was  in very mathematical branches of economic theory, such as principal-agent theory  and monetary theory, but over time, he's actually become  much more of what you might call a quantitative economic anthropologist. Starting in 1998, he went to Thailand and, choosing 16 villages, began to collect systematic data on the incomes and consumption patterns of individual families in those villages. This became a data set  of unprecedented quality.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I163VaiwdEE
Robert Townsend,"When you think of the recent trend in development economics toward developing one's own data set and going out in the field and getting very specific information about individuals, Townsend was really a methodological pioneer. The work of Townsend is important, not only for its method but what we learn from that method. So Townsend and his co-authors have taken these many years of data from Thailand and, to some extent, India,  and asked questions about risk. How do individuals respond to risk? What if there's a bad crop one year, perhaps because of bad weather?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I163VaiwdEE
Robert Townsend,"What happens if some other catastrophe or misfortune befalls a family? How do incomes respond? How do consumption patterns respond? These were the questions which motivated his data-gathering efforts. Townsend's work shows that even when  explicit insurance markets are absent, in the sense of you can't go out and buy a policy from an insurance company, there are nonetheless many forms of implicit insurance which can involve gifts, or favor trading, or loans, or sharing of income,  or other kinds of mutual aid.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I163VaiwdEE
Robert Townsend,"In one of his papers, he found  that gifts from other households in the same village equal about 9% of average expenditure. That's quite a bit. If a negative shock hits  an individual household in a village, that household tends  to receive aid and loans from other households in the same village. If a negative shock hits an entire village, well, that village, as a whole,  tends to receive aid and loans and other forms of indirect assistance  from the surrounding region. These are, again, both forms of risk-sharing.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I163VaiwdEE
Robert Townsend,"Townsend came up with  some very clever empirical tests. For instance, imagine a world where  there is no implicit insurance and then there is a common  negative shock hitting a village. What we would expect is that  the decline of income for that village will predict a decline  in consumption quite well, because the people in that village can't draw upon resources from anywhere else. But what Townsend finds is that, in a lot of instances, what predicts consumption  in the individual village is not shocks to the income of the village, but rather shocks to the income  of the immediate surrounding region. So, for instance, if the one village is doing poorly but the region is doing better, there will be an inflow of resources,  loans, aid favor, trading, whatever.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I163VaiwdEE
Robert Townsend,"And if you find that it's the income  of the surrounding region which is predicting village consumption, that means the broader region,  in some way, is helping out the individual village through implicit insurance when the village needs that aid. Townsend's work shows  some other very interesting results. For instance, individuals tend to be more insured if they have kin living  in the same village. That is, there are more people who are willing and able to help them out. He finds also that  entrepreneurs, on average, or the individuals  who bear the most risk and who are least likely  to receive insurance, perhaps they simply have  a taste for greater risk or they have more resources, and Townsend finds that,  although implicit insurance is very important in these poorer villages, that, in general, there is not  full insurance in these cases.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I163VaiwdEE
Robert Townsend,"So that when bad things happen at the level of an individual family or individual village, there is real suffering,  there's an inflow of aid or loans, but that inflow doesn't make up completely for the bad event by any means. So exposure to risk is mitigated,  but, at the same time, exposure to risk really does matter. It's a striking result to find that  individuals in relatively poor villages actually might be safer than you think. But this isn't just a general proclamation. Because of his data gathering and his extremely careful methods, Townsend has given us  a pretty careful glimpse into exactly how risk-sharing works in some poorer parts of the world.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I163VaiwdEE
Robert Townsend,"To learn more about Townsend, it's pretty simple and direct. Go to scholar. google.com, type in his name. Also, you can Google  ""Robert Townsend economist"". He's not the only famous Robert Townsend, so put in that word ""economist"".",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I163VaiwdEE

Amartya Sen #1,"Amartya Sen is an Indian  and Bengali economist born in 1933 and winner  of a Nobel Prize in economics. Sen is such an important figure in development that he is going to get several video units. When Sen was appointed to  Harvard University, he received a professorship not  only in the economics department, but also in the philosophy department. So we are going to start with  Sen on philosophy. Development economists or policy advisers often find themselves in the position of having to address: now, what really is a good outcome anyway?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcBzS5nDLMg
Amartya Sen #1,"The typical standard of economics is to identify a good outcome with greater wealth or higher GDP. But Sen made the point that  a country can be wealthy but perhaps not everyone  in that country is very happy, or maybe people don't live very long, or maybe they have lives which are, by some standards, impoverished or lacking. So Sen has been a consistent critic of using wealth or GDP as a metric for a good outcome. A second common standard is to ask: how happy are the people in the given country or region? But Sen makes the point that happiness is an extremely subjective thing to judge, it's very hard to say who is happy  and who is not.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcBzS5nDLMg
Amartya Sen #1,"Finally, some philosophers, some observers suggest what is called: the basic need standard for a developing economy. Look at a region and ask: Do people in that place  have their basic needs satisfied? But which exactly needs are basic and which are not basic? Sen has stressed the point, that  the basic need standard; is about what you send people and is not really about what they can do with what they've been sent. So for all these reasons, Sen has rejected wealth,  happiness, and basic needs as the best standards for a good outcome.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcBzS5nDLMg
Amartya Sen #1,"what then? Sen suggests the notion of capabilities, capabilities as a positive option. Which are the choices that people have which they are free to realize? What are the things they can do? What is within their grasp?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcBzS5nDLMg
Amartya Sen #1,"What kind of lives do they have? What kind of possible achievements can they choose from? This is Sen's notion of what is a good outcome. When one outcome offers better capabilities to the citizens of a region than another, we can judge that to be  the better outcome. For Sen, capabilities is an absolute concept, not a relative concept, it doesn't depend upon comparing the options of one person to another.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcBzS5nDLMg
Amartya Sen #1,"And the notion of capabilities for Sen; it also respects human diversity. That is, it notes that simply  sending people resources doesn't make their lives good. The question is what can people do with those resources? So Sen, at one point, makes the example of a bicycle. If you send a bicycle to a person who is disabled, you haven't actually improved  that person's capabilities very much if the disabled person does not have  the capacity to ride the bicycle.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcBzS5nDLMg
Amartya Sen #1,"This is all very abstract  and philosophical. What does it mean in the concrete level? Well, people disagree, but one thing is for sure: Sen developed these ideas in the 1980s and they have had a big impact on the United Nations Human Development Index. The Human Development Index  doesn't tell me to look at wealth but it looks at life expectancy,  adult literacy, and school enrollment and judging how good an outcome is, and judging how developed a country is. Sen himself stresses that he does not have a particular or exact list in mind for the relevant capabilities.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcBzS5nDLMg
Amartya Sen #1,"From Sen's point of view, it's really something that an individual country or region needs to choose using a democratic process. But other people who have  been influenced by Sen, they have talked quite a bit about what the capabilities should be. Some philosophers have suggested health, play, imagination,  gender equality, autonomy, freedom of speech, all as being possibly important parts of the capabilities concept. Where do we stand with this? The critics say that Sen's ocean of capabilities makes some sense, but it's very hard to operationalize.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcBzS5nDLMg
Amartya Sen #1,"We do have one operationalization:  the UN Development Index. It remains to be seen how much more useful we can make sense notion of capabilities. But when it comes to how do we judge, whether one outcome is better than another, it does seem the idea of capabilities  has important advantages over wealth, happiness, or basic needs.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcBzS5nDLMg
Daron Acemoglu,today let's talk about Daron Acemoglu as a mogul who has spent much of his career at MIT he's one of the leading contemporary development economists and more generally he's brought the study of political economy back into economics Acemoglu is considered someone who specializes in big-picture thinking the broader historical sweep of economic development and how it ties into property rights incentives and most of all institutions Acemoglu has also had a big impact on labor economics with numerous significant papers but we're going to focus on his contributions to economic development it's important to note that a lot of SML blues work has been with Simon Johnson and James a Robinson both excellent economists who deserve a lot of recognition too if there's a core theme a nasa mogul whose work it's that institutions matter political economy matters it matters how effective structures of governance are set up that with good governance there will be economic growth and economic development but with bad governance it will boil down to a zero or negative sum game and wealth will be destroyed instead of created Acemoglu is the economist to today has done more than anyone else to drive home the relevance of these themes and he does it by mixing history empirical investigation and economic reasoning a key point for Acemoglu is the distinction between extractive and inclusive institutions think of extractive institutions as politics designed simply to take wealth from one group of people very often the poor and give it to another group of people very oftenly politically connected slavery is an extreme form of an extractive institution but you also could consider very high rates of taxation or mercantilist regulations and trade barriers designed to prop up say some businesses or corporations at the expense of the pocketbooks of regular consumers in contrast inclusive institutions take into account the interests of a large number of people and there goal is to elevate the general standard of living in society and they do that usually by producing wealth by making sure that the rules of the game are fairly enforced and perhaps sometimes supporting forms of redistribution but redistribution rooted in some idea of the general welfare and a social safety net rather than just transferring resources to people who are politically the best connected one if Assam oh glues best-known papers is called reversal of fortune and it was written with Johnson and Robinson it starts with the key point that the wealthy regions in the year 1500 are very often not so wealthy today for instance that might include the Mughals in India and the Aztecs and the Incas and the Americans in 1500 the civilizations in say North America New Zealand and Australia were not so wealthy but of course those are extremely wealthy areas today so what happened this paper argues that if a region was relatively empty in the year 1500 and thus probably relatively poor that region was settled by the Europeans it tended to have a predominance of European institutions and it had the kind of European institutions which over time evolved into being more inclusive perhaps the early settlers of these regions did say kill or drive out a lot of the native inhabitants but the notion that the native inhabitants were not so populous meant that you couldn't settle the region by enslaving all of them you needed to set up some institutions to produce wealth in contrast the more populous regions usually were conquered and then you had more forms of slavery more forms of wealth extraction and in general institutions which were more geared toward ruling over people rather than producing wealth so when the hypothesis of this paper the great reversal of fortune which starts around the Year 1500 is really about economic institutions and it's not about economic geography another very well known paper by Acemoglu is about whether settler mortality mattered and this is titled the colonial origins of comparative development the key hypothesis here is that in regions where the mortality of colonial settlers was high they didn't want to set up stakes and build a very productive economy rather they wanted to come and grab things and put into place extractive institutions rather than inclusive institutions not everyone agrees with the data set behind this paper but still it has been a highly influential and well sited result Acemoglu and Robinson have a very important and very successful book on development called why nations fail the origins of power prosperity and poverty you can think of this book as a very large compendium of examples and analyses of the importance of this difference between extractive and inclusive institutions ASIMO glues work is generally quite accessible and there's a lot of it available on the web and easy to consume forms for instance Ian Robinson have been writing a blog about their book called why nations fail you can also find them on Twitter under the handle at why nations fail again there's the book with s mo glue and Robinson you can put s mo glues name in to scholar.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ByAukZeDA

Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"I donât know where he and Professor Sachs are going to go in their conversation today, but Iâm sure itâs going to be challenging. Itâs going to be interesting. Above all, itâs going to be smart. Again, on behalf of the Mercatus Center, thank you all for joining us today. Please join me in welcoming Tyler Cowen and Jeffrey Sachs.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"[applause] TYLER COWEN: I introduce Jeff Sachs; thatâs easy. Jeff is one of the worldâs best, most famous, and most influential economists. Thereâs more I could say, but letâs start with that. The purpose of these series is to have conversations that you donât find other places on YouTube, and to ask probing questions and have a far-ranging dialogue. What Iâd like to do is kind of overview of Jeffâs career and thought and try and see how it all hangs together, how the different pieces relate to each other.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"What Iâd like to do is start with some of the early pieces, from the â80s and 1990s. Then weâll work our way up to the present. The first question, Jeff, and weâll treat this as a dialogue. Some of your best-cited work has been on the natural resource curse: the idea that economies, when they have natural resourcesâsuch as oilâthat can harm their prospects for growth rather than helping them. Now weâre in 2015.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"How do you see this issue today? Do you think that has changed in any way since the first thesis you wrote? JEFFREY SACHS: First, let me say thank you for having me. Iâm really looking forward to our discussion. About 25 years ago, I started looking more and more at my own work and how economic structure, geography, resource base, and so forth affected development.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Iâve been on a learning curve since then. One of the early works that I engaged in at that point with Andrew Warner and others was looking at this question of how resource wealth, resource dependence one could say, affected development. We found back in the 1990s, looking for the preceding 25 years or so, that the oil-rich countries had grown less rapidly, controlling for seemingly other factors that would be relevant. We started to speculate about that. Thereâs now a huge literature from many different points of view: politics, pure economics, and so forth.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Itâs a pretty rich subject and not so simple to summarize. There really is a resource curse for a lot of resource-rich countries. At this point, looking back, I would put more weight on the political economy aspects probably than the pure, market-driven âDutch diseaseâ aspects which I talked about a quarter century ago. The idea at the time was that if you have resource wealth that pulls you away from more labor-intensive and technology-intensive industries. You donât learn as much.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"You donât develop as much endogenous growth. Now I would say if you have resource wealth, one problem is youâre likely to be invaded. You have more vulnerability to geopolitics as well as to internal politics to mess things up. TYLER COWEN: Is this a habit you can kick or is it path dependence? The price of oil now is quite low.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Do you think those countries that have a lot of oil, now theyâre going to be better off because theyâll be put on this new development path, or is it somehow too late, that theyâre stuck with the bad institutions? JEFFREY SACHS: First, one of the things that Iâve tried to emphasize and that Iâve learned over time is itâs always pretty complicated. There are resource-rich countries that do very well, thank you. There are resource-rich countries that have fallen apart a long time ago and never gotten out of the mess. Any generalization is fraught with problems.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Norway will do well, whether the oil price is high or low. On the other hand, last time the world oil price was persistently low, the Soviet Union collapsed. Russia was near hyperinflation. Different countries under different conditions will adjust to these shocks. Resource-rich Norway, Australia, CanadaâI wouldnât worry too much about them.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Their currencies will weaken. They will find other things to do, whereas some of the very vulnerable countries that have never been able to kick the habit of dependence, like Venezuela, will probably go into a deeper crisis. The Middle East has been in flames now for years. I donât see any easy way out there, either. TYLER COWEN: Hereâs the tension Iâm trying to figure out.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"It relates to a number of issues in your thought. Youâve written some very interesting pieces lately about how the role of institutions is overrated in predicting growth, but institutions seem to play a key role in making the resource theory stick. As you say, Norway has done fine. The US in earlier times did fine with a lot of natural resources. Does thinking about resources lead you back to seeing institutions as important in some new and different way or are you still basically skeptical about institutions mattering at all and wanting to look most of all to geography?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Do you see what Iâm getting at? JEFFREY SACHS: Of course, but again, Iâll say it repeatedly, Iâve never said institutions donât matter. Iâve said institutions arenât the only thing. I find often that people take an idea and carry it to an extreme. This âinstitution mattersâ idea is one of those that Iâve found taken to extremes by causing a kind of geographic blindness, if I could say it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,Geography obviously matters a lot. Resource base matters a lot. Institutions matter a lot. The worldâs complex. Weâre dealing with complex systems.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Itâs not surprising that different things matter at different times and different places. Of course, institutions make a difference. The art of good economics, in my view, is trying to figure out whatâs important, where, when, and in which context. TYLER COWEN: Hereâs a claim youâve made. Itâs very striking.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Itâs one of the most important claims in development economics. Personally, I think itâs true. When you reviewed Acemoglu and Robinson, you said, âIf we go to the year 1960, even knowing who the winners and losers have been, much less forget about forecasting, itâs very hard to come up with a metric of institutions that predicts which countries end up doing well and which countries end up doing poorlyâ. When I read that, I tend to think somehow weâre mismeasuring institutional quality. We really need a better measure of institutions, which we donât have yet.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Institutions will someday matter again, but Iâm looking for this in vain. Where does your thought stand on this now? Do you actually think thereâs some deeper understanding of institutions that will rescue this proposition? When you throw out North Korea and some other crazy countries, institutions donât really have the predictive power for growth. What are your thoughts on this, given that in the across-country regressions, they can do so poorly within the set of semireasonable countries?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"JEFFREY SACHS: Acemoglu and Robinsonâs book Why Nations Fail was one of my least favorite books. I think it is just a bad book, because it takes one thought and tries to drive it as the only explanation of history. Thatâs not a good approach in my view to history, which is a very interesting, complex tableau. They missed one fundamental point right from the start, which is that when you look at development, there are at least two fundamental drivers, not just one. The one that they talk about is innovation, and innovation as being a fundamental driver of growth.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Thereâs a lot of truth to that in the history of the world. But thereâs a second fundamental aspect when we look out in the world and say, âWhoâs doing well? Whoâs doing badly? Why? â and so forth.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Thatâs what is sometimes called âcatching upâ. The phenomenon of catching up is very different from the phenomenon of forging ahead at the front of the technology horizon. When you take that simple distinction, it helps to explain a lot of the post-1960 question that youâre asking. The most successful countries in the world in the last 50 years have been basically the East Asian economies and Southeast Asian economies. Very rarely do they look like the textbook model of Acemoglu and Robinson of the free market economy and so forth.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"In fact, the Peopleâs Republic of China they characterize as justâthatâs an anomaly that is going to collapse in the future so we donât have to explain it now. I think thatâs a huge mistake and a misunderstanding of the basics. Chinaâs in a catching-up mode. The institutions of catching up are quite different from the institutions of being the technology leader, for example. Just understanding that would give them a little more clarity about institutions, per se.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"TYLER COWEN: And corruption, over- or underrated as a driver of growth? JEFFREY SACHS: It depends. Some places are so corrupt you first wouldnât want to step foot in them and Iâve had the experience repeatedly when Iâm talking to a head of state or a finance minister and I watch their eyes glaze over and realize theyâre not interested in what youâre talking about. Theyâre in a different game. Those places can be driven absolutely into the ground by corruption.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Other places have been corrupt for a long timeâIâm thinking of New York, Washington, Lagos, Beijing, and other placesâand you get a lot of economic progress. In that sense, there is no purity in the world. Iâm not a fan of corruption for a lot of reasons that have started with the ethics. TYLER COWEN: Chinaâs massively corrupt and itâs growing at high rates, right? JEFFREY SACHS: China has a lot of corruption.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"The first person to say it is President Xi. The US has a huge amount of corruption and it has done reasonably well over the last 200 years. TYLER COWEN: Let me now ask you a question to challenge the audience, and weâre going to turn to Paul Rosenstein-Rodan, whoâs somewhat of a forgotten figure. But I think still an important figure at George Mason, and maybe for you too. As you know, Rosenstein-Rodan was a development economist.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"He was one of the pioneers of the notion of the big push of an extended move forward on many fronts, all at the same time. But when you look at the early years of his thought, he studied with Mises. He worked with Hayek. He was an Austrian. He was a subjectivist, methodological individualist, and he made some kind of theoretical shift in his mind.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"What is it that you think that Paul Rosenstein-Rodan saw, and presumably you think you see it as well, that the people today who are still Austrians at the theoretical level, what is it that Rosenstein-Rodan saw that allowed him to make that shift or induced him to make that shift at the most basic conceptual level? JEFFREY SACHS: He was writing during and at the end of World War II, when he was saying, âHow are we going to get out of this mess? There are so many pieces that have to be put together. We have to get infrastructure built again. We have to get basic markets operating.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"There are a lot of interconnected pieces, and so weâre going to have to move on a lot of frontsâ. He was facing a historical situation. I would say that his ideaâIâd go back even . . .",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"actually, itâs not back. It was almost contemporaneous with him. Alexander Gerschenkron, who was a very clever economic historian at Harvard. I came as a student just as he was retiring. He was a great mid-century, mid-20th century economic historian.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"He observed that what countries do for development depends on how they stand in relation to the leader, and this is a point I was making earlier, which is that catching up is a fundamental phenomenon in development. Thereâs a difference of growth, which we study as an economy, how does it grow? From the question of catching up, which is a question for a country that is situated with weak technology, weak infrastructure, weak training, and so forth. In the face of advanced economies, what should they do? Now thatâs been a question thatâs been asked for at least 224 years, since Alexander Hamilton sent his letter to the congress on manufacturing in the United States.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Because he said we have to catch up with Britain. Then Friedrich List said, âWe have to catch up with Britainâ. Economic reformers from basically Hamilton on in countries that were lagging behind the lead said, âWhat do we do to catch up? â Now you can carry this too far because the insane version of this, and the unbelievably destructive version of this, was Lenin and Stalin. We have to do anything at no matter what cost of life to catch up, or Mao in the Great Leap Forward, which is insanity and cruelty.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"But, on the other hand, the idea that you do different things to catch up by accelerating the process or by making the big push in a variety of ways has been shown time and again to have a lot of merit. Itâs a balance, once more. The first countries to develop, Britain and the United States . . .",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Take the US. Weâve achieved almost continuous 1.8 percent per year per capita growth for the last 200 years. Not bad, if you do it for 200 years. But if youâre an impoverished country today and you say, âWhatâs our aim? 1.8 percent growth?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"â No, our aim is 10 percent growth, because we really need to catch up. It turned out, because of that catching-up phenomenon, you can make a very, very rapid advance in a way unthinkable for a country in front. But how do you make that advance? Through pure government just stepping back and letting things happen? No.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Through a concerted policy to close gaps. Thatâs the difference. TYLER COWEN: Iâve been reviewing your work, including these books, and a stack of papers here, which is a small fraction of what youâve written. I believe they all have your name on them. What I try to do with thinkers sometimes is boil down what theyâve been writing to the smallest number of dimensions possible.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"If youâll bear with me for a moment, Iâm going to try to do that with you, and then you tell me where Iâm off, or what you would add to that. Reviewing all the things youâve written . . . JEFFREY SACHS: You probably know more about me than I do, so letâs see how it goes.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"[laughter] TYLER COWEN: Maybe. But there are two phrases that strike me again and again. One is when you mention your wife, Sonia, and talk about differential diagnostics. The other is what you call the epoch of the Anthropocene, which you could think of as the time when human beings are in the world in an active way. When we start with primitive society, everything is determined by geography and resources.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Economic development, in a sense, is an ongoing process where human beings impose their will and their reason on the world in a kind of planning or voluntaristic fashion. Then thereâs a belief that first this needs to be done in a differential way. Not the same recipe everywhere. But a belief in the power of human reason to perform these differential diagnostics to turn this era when humans are on the earth into a time when weâre no longer ruled by resources and geography and the prevalence of malaria. But brought into an era where human reason is in some sense running the show.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"If I had to boil down my reread of you into a very short bulletin, thatâs what I would say. Now do you agree with that, how would you change it, and what would you add to that? JEFFREY SACHS: Thatâs pretty good, first of all. I would subscribe to that summary. I should explain this idea of clinical economics, as Iâve called it, or differential diagnosis.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"When youâre married to a pediatrician, as I have been for 35 wonderful years, you get up in the middle of the night a lot when patients call with a very sick child. Iâve listened to my wife take an oral history a thousandâthousands of times, perhaps. Itâs a wonderful art, first of all, because a mother calls with a crisis of a baby or a young childâusually a high fever. The first thing that is important to know is that there are a thousand possible etiologies of that fever. My wife doesnât say institutions.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4

Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"â. No, when it comes to the child, it could be something as normal as a common cold or a something as devastating as meningitis. The purpose of a differential diagnosis is two things. First, it is of course to try to get to the core reasons so that you can make a proper prescription based on a proper diagnosis. Second, itâs done in a way that youâre minimizing serious risk.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"The first question always that my wife asks is, âIs the babyâs neck stiff, or do you notice that? â Because thatâs one of the symptoms of meningitis.

Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"I certainly didnât learn them, and it took me a long time of seeing lots of âpatientsâ to see that one needs that same kind of approach. Thatâs what I mean by differential diagnosis. Why itâs so annoying to me, the one explanation fits all viewpoints. Because now Iâve seen a lot of places, a lot of crises, a lot of challenges. One of the things that I discovered was how poor our profession is at times in having that sense that the problem that you saw over there is not the same as the problem that youâre seeing here.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4

Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Weâre in a law school, but still, if I may say, in some ways a step down. To some extent you have people voting on the baby, not all of whom even know who the baby is or what the babyâs symptoms are. The differential diagnostics may exist in a kind of platonic realm, but you are more optimistic about them than I am. What would you tell me to address my skepticism and make me more of a Sachsian, given that I have this reluctance to embrace your view the way you hold it?

I tend to believe thereâs a way out of a crisis, and I tend to believe that a lot of what poses as either pure zero-sum struggle or harsh ideological conflict is often resolvable by good, clear ideas, or good, clear evidence, or a good, clear game plan.

Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"It came out last year. Itâs received attention, but less so from economists, for obvious reasons. Itâs a book about leaders sitting down and just doing something and basically getting it right. Is that fair to say? Solvingâmore or less solving the Cuban Missile Crisis, defusing tensions, avoiding nuclear war, right?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"JEFFREY SACHS: Itâs a book, yes, of this remarkable last year of Kennedyâs life, which included the Cuban Missile Crisis and then negotiating the partial nuclear test ban treaty. Basically, I find it a story of tremendous insight and very moving also. If I could put it in pure conceptual jargon, itâs a story of finding a way to the cooperative outcome of a prisonerâs dilemma. Thatâs, to my mind, a crucial structural feature of our lives, which is that we face constantly this challenge of finding agreement. We face constantly the logic of defection, as itâs called in the prisonerâs dilemma, or the noncooperative outcome thatâs worse for everybody.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4

The idealists say, âThe world will always agree, or we should always act that wayâ.

JEFFREY SACHS: For me, it also went off in my head as I learned more about this, which is that Kennedy and Khrushchev stumbled into nearly the end of the world in October of 1962, and Kennedy made his share of terrible mistakes. Our USG, which Iâm usually not too much of a fan of, made its share of terrible mistakes, whether itâs Bay of Pigs or other things. One by one, we stumbledânot to the desire of either of these leadersâto the point where we were within the hairâs breadth of total annihilation. So many stupid things happen in this world, as almost happened again.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4

So to me, it is a paradigm of how we can stay alive in this world and actually get somewhere.

It needs teachers and it needs doctors and it needs construction workers and it needs engineers and it needs public administration and it needs everything, because itâs coming from poor, rural, overwhelmingly agriculture.

Lo and behold, after one year of a little bit of experimentation on how to plant them, he and M. S. Swaminathan found that you could use Mexican seeds in the Indian context in the Punjab.

Now, because of the long history of Japanese development, because of the 50-year history of Korean and Taiwanese, Hong Kong, Singapore development, and especially because of the post-1978 scale of Chinaâs achievement, East Asia is an absolutely key, transformative growth pole of the world.

Thatâs my view that if you approached it that wayâbecause I remember arguing with Summers that weekend, and many weekends after thatâapproach it as unlocking the financial panic, not as the need for reaching a $1.6 trillion deficit in 2009.

Many dry places now, which are often on the descending zone of convective forces like in Hadley cell, become drier with climate change because these convective forces become more powerful.

I donât like training economists without them grappling with real problems in real places and learning the complexity of the interacting physical, technological, political, economic, natural systems. Itâs the complexity of these interacting systems that defines how we need to respond. Weâre not training students that way. Weâre training them in general principles or in very fancy statistical exercises that actually miss the point.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Just a final word about that. We have so much statistical machinery to ask the question, âWhat can you learn from this dataset? â Thatâs the wrong question because the dataset is always a tiny, tiny fraction of what you can know about the problem that youâre studying. If you want to know about the problem, get out there and learn about it. Donât think that youâre going to find it in your dataset.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"For that we need a different kind of epistemological approach and a different kind of teaching approach as well. I want our students out on the hospital wards, as it were, but that means being out in the world working and solving problems and dealing with people across many different fields and many different parts of social systems to be able to aggregate to and integrate into meaningful holistic solutions.

Please join me in welcoming Tyler Cowen and Jeffrey Sachs. [applause] TYLER COWEN: I introduce Jeff Sachs; thatâs easy. Jeff is one of the worldâs best, most famous, and most influential economists.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Thereâs more I could say, but letâs start with that. The purpose of these series is to have conversations that you donât find other places on YouTube, and to ask probing questions and have a far-ranging dialogue. What Iâd like to do is kind of overview of Jeffâs career and thought and try and see how it all hangs together, how the different pieces relate to each other. What Iâd like to do is start with some of the early pieces, from the â80s and 1990s. Then weâll work our way up to the present.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"The first question, Jeff, and weâll treat this as a dialogue. Some of your best-cited work has been on the natural resource curse: the idea that economies, when they have natural resourcesâsuch as oilâthat can harm their prospects for growth rather than helping them. Now weâre in 2015. How do you see this issue today? Do you think that has changed in any way since the first thesis you wrote?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"JEFFREY SACHS: First, let me say thank you for having me. Iâm really looking forward to our discussion. About 25 years ago, I started looking more and more at my own work and how economic structure, geography, resource base, and so forth affected development. Iâve been on a learning curve since then. One of the early works that I engaged in at that point with Andrew Warner and others was looking at this question of how resource wealth, resource dependence one could say, affected development.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"We found back in the 1990s, looking for the preceding 25 years or so, that the oil-rich countries had grown less rapidly, controlling for seemingly other factors that would be relevant. We started to speculate about that. Thereâs now a huge literature from many different points of view: politics, pure economics, and so forth. Itâs a pretty rich subject and not so simple to summarize. There really is a resource curse for a lot of resource-rich countries.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"At this point, looking back, I would put more weight on the political economy aspects probably than the pure, market-driven âDutch diseaseâ aspects which I talked about a quarter century ago. The idea at the time was that if you have resource wealth that pulls you away from more labor-intensive and technology-intensive industries. You donât learn as much. You donât develop as much endogenous growth. Now I would say if you have resource wealth, one problem is youâre likely to be invaded.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"You have more vulnerability to geopolitics as well as to internal politics to mess things up. TYLER COWEN: Is this a habit you can kick or is it path dependence? The price of oil now is quite low. Do you think those countries that have a lot of oil, now theyâre going to be better off because theyâll be put on this new development path, or is it somehow too late, that theyâre stuck with the bad institutions? JEFFREY SACHS: First, one of the things that Iâve tried to emphasize and that Iâve learned over time is itâs always pretty complicated.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"There are resource-rich countries that do very well, thank you. There are resource-rich countries that have fallen apart a long time ago and never gotten out of the mess. Any generalization is fraught with problems. Norway will do well, whether the oil price is high or low. On the other hand, last time the world oil price was persistently low, the Soviet Union collapsed.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Russia was near hyperinflation. Different countries under different conditions will adjust to these shocks. Resource-rich Norway, Australia, CanadaâI wouldnât worry too much about them. Their currencies will weaken. They will find other things to do, whereas some of the very vulnerable countries that have never been able to kick the habit of dependence, like Venezuela, will probably go into a deeper crisis.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"The Middle East has been in flames now for years. I donât see any easy way out there, either. TYLER COWEN: Hereâs the tension Iâm trying to figure out. It relates to a number of issues in your thought. Youâve written some very interesting pieces lately about how the role of institutions is overrated in predicting growth, but institutions seem to play a key role in making the resource theory stick.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"As you say, Norway has done fine. The US in earlier times did fine with a lot of natural resources. Does thinking about resources lead you back to seeing institutions as important in some new and different way or are you still basically skeptical about institutions mattering at all and wanting to look most of all to geography? Do you see what Iâm getting at? JEFFREY SACHS: Of course, but again, Iâll say it repeatedly, Iâve never said institutions donât matter.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Iâve said institutions arenât the only thing. I find often that people take an idea and carry it to an extreme. This âinstitution mattersâ idea is one of those that Iâve found taken to extremes by causing a kind of geographic blindness, if I could say it. Geography obviously matters a lot. Resource base matters a lot.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Institutions matter a lot. The worldâs complex. Weâre dealing with complex systems. Itâs not surprising that different things matter at different times and different places. Of course, institutions make a difference.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"The art of good economics, in my view, is trying to figure out whatâs important, where, when, and in which context. TYLER COWEN: Hereâs a claim youâve made. Itâs very striking. Itâs one of the most important claims in development economics. Personally, I think itâs true.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"When you reviewed Acemoglu and Robinson, you said, âIf we go to the year 1960, even knowing who the winners and losers have been, much less forget about forecasting, itâs very hard to come up with a metric of institutions that predicts which countries end up doing well and which countries end up doing poorlyâ. When I read that, I tend to think somehow weâre mismeasuring institutional quality. We really need a better measure of institutions, which we donât have yet. Institutions will someday matter again, but Iâm looking for this in vain. Where does your thought stand on this now?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Do you actually think thereâs some deeper understanding of institutions that will rescue this proposition? When you throw out North Korea and some other crazy countries, institutions donât really have the predictive power for growth. What are your thoughts on this, given that in the across-country regressions, they can do so poorly within the set of semireasonable countries? JEFFREY SACHS: Acemoglu and Robinsonâs book Why Nations Fail was one of my least favorite books. I think it is just a bad book, because it takes one thought and tries to drive it as the only explanation of history.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Thatâs not a good approach in my view to history, which is a very interesting, complex tableau. They missed one fundamental point right from the start, which is that when you look at development, there are at least two fundamental drivers, not just one. The one that they talk about is innovation, and innovation as being a fundamental driver of growth. Thereâs a lot of truth to that in the history of the world. But thereâs a second fundamental aspect when we look out in the world and say, âWhoâs doing well?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,Whoâs doing badly? Why? â and so forth. Thatâs what is sometimes called âcatching upâ. The phenomenon of catching up is very different from the phenomenon of forging ahead at the front of the technology horizon.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"When you take that simple distinction, it helps to explain a lot of the post-1960 question that youâre asking. The most successful countries in the world in the last 50 years have been basically the East Asian economies and Southeast Asian economies. Very rarely do they look like the textbook model of Acemoglu and Robinson of the free market economy and so forth. In fact, the Peopleâs Republic of China they characterize as justâthatâs an anomaly that is going to collapse in the future so we donât have to explain it now. I think thatâs a huge mistake and a misunderstanding of the basics.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Chinaâs in a catching-up mode. The institutions of catching up are quite different from the institutions of being the technology leader, for example. Just understanding that would give them a little more clarity about institutions, per se. TYLER COWEN: And corruption, over- or underrated as a driver of growth? JEFFREY SACHS: It depends.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Some places are so corrupt you first wouldnât want to step foot in them and Iâve had the experience repeatedly when Iâm talking to a head of state or a finance minister and I watch their eyes glaze over and realize theyâre not interested in what youâre talking about. Theyâre in a different game. Those places can be driven absolutely into the ground by corruption. Other places have been corrupt for a long timeâIâm thinking of New York, Washington, Lagos, Beijing, and other placesâand you get a lot of economic progress. In that sense, there is no purity in the world.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Iâm not a fan of corruption for a lot of reasons that have started with the ethics. TYLER COWEN: Chinaâs massively corrupt and itâs growing at high rates, right? JEFFREY SACHS: China has a lot of corruption. The first person to say it is President Xi. The US has a huge amount of corruption and it has done reasonably well over the last 200 years.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"TYLER COWEN: Let me now ask you a question to challenge the audience, and weâre going to turn to Paul Rosenstein-Rodan, whoâs somewhat of a forgotten figure. But I think still an important figure at George Mason, and maybe for you too. As you know, Rosenstein-Rodan was a development economist. He was one of the pioneers of the notion of the big push of an extended move forward on many fronts, all at the same time. But when you look at the early years of his thought, he studied with Mises.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"He worked with Hayek. He was an Austrian. He was a subjectivist, methodological individualist, and he made some kind of theoretical shift in his mind. What is it that you think that Paul Rosenstein-Rodan saw, and presumably you think you see it as well, that the people today who are still Austrians at the theoretical level, what is it that Rosenstein-Rodan saw that allowed him to make that shift or induced him to make that shift at the most basic conceptual level? JEFFREY SACHS: He was writing during and at the end of World War II, when he was saying, âHow are we going to get out of this mess?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"There are so many pieces that have to be put together. We have to get infrastructure built again. We have to get basic markets operating. There are a lot of interconnected pieces, and so weâre going to have to move on a lot of frontsâ. He was facing a historical situation.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"I would say that his ideaâIâd go back even . . . actually, itâs not back. It was almost contemporaneous with him.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Alexander Gerschenkron, who was a very clever economic historian at Harvard. I came as a student just as he was retiring. He was a great mid-century, mid-20th century economic historian. He observed that what countries do for development depends on how they stand in relation to the leader, and this is a point I was making earlier, which is that catching up is a fundamental phenomenon in development. Thereâs a difference of growth, which we study as an economy, how does it grow?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"From the question of catching up, which is a question for a country that is situated with weak technology, weak infrastructure, weak training, and so forth. In the face of advanced economies, what should they do? Now thatâs been a question thatâs been asked for at least 224 years, since Alexander Hamilton sent his letter to the congress on manufacturing in the United States. Because he said we have to catch up with Britain. Then Friedrich List said, âWe have to catch up with Britainâ.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Economic reformers from basically Hamilton on in countries that were lagging behind the lead said, âWhat do we do to catch up? â Now you can carry this too far because the insane version of this, and the unbelievably destructive version of this, was Lenin and Stalin. We have to do anything at no matter what cost of life to catch up, or Mao in the Great Leap Forward, which is insanity and cruelty. But, on the other hand, the idea that you do different things to catch up by accelerating the process or by making the big push in a variety of ways has been shown time and again to have a lot of merit. Itâs a balance, once more.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"The first countries to develop, Britain and the United States . . . Take the US. Weâve achieved almost continuous 1.8 percent per year per capita growth for the last 200 years.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Not bad, if you do it for 200 years. But if youâre an impoverished country today and you say, âWhatâs our aim? 1.8 percent growth? â No, our aim is 10 percent growth, because we really need to catch up. It turned out, because of that catching-up phenomenon, you can make a very, very rapid advance in a way unthinkable for a country in front.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,But how do you make that advance? Through pure government just stepping back and letting things happen? No. Through a concerted policy to close gaps. Thatâs the difference.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"TYLER COWEN: Iâve been reviewing your work, including these books, and a stack of papers here, which is a small fraction of what youâve written. I believe they all have your name on them. What I try to do with thinkers sometimes is boil down what theyâve been writing to the smallest number of dimensions possible. If youâll bear with me for a moment, Iâm going to try to do that with you, and then you tell me where Iâm off, or what you would add to that.

Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"One is when you mention your wife, Sonia, and talk about differential diagnostics. The other is what you call the epoch of the Anthropocene, which you could think of as the time when human beings are in the world in an active way. When we start with primitive society, everything is determined by geography and resources. Economic development, in a sense, is an ongoing process where human beings impose their will and their reason on the world in a kind of planning or voluntaristic fashion. Then thereâs a belief that first this needs to be done in a differential way.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Not the same recipe everywhere. But a belief in the power of human reason to perform these differential diagnostics to turn this era when humans are on the earth into a time when weâre no longer ruled by resources and geography and the prevalence of malaria. But brought into an era where human reason is in some sense running the show. If I had to boil down my reread of you into a very short bulletin, thatâs what I would say. Now do you agree with that, how would you change it, and what would you add to that?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"JEFFREY SACHS: Thatâs pretty good, first of all. I would subscribe to that summary. I should explain this idea of clinical economics, as Iâve called it, or differential diagnosis. When youâre married to a pediatrician, as I have been for 35 wonderful years, you get up in the middle of the night a lot when patients call with a very sick child. Iâve listened to my wife take an oral history a thousandâthousands of times, perhaps.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Itâs a wonderful art, first of all, because a mother calls with a crisis of a baby or a young childâusually a high fever. The first thing that is important to know is that there are a thousand possible etiologies of that fever. My wife doesnât say institutions. She says . .",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4

No, when it comes to the child, it could be something as normal as a common cold or a something as devastating as meningitis.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"The purpose of a differential diagnosis is two things. First, it is of course to try to get to the core reasons so that you can make a proper prescription based on a proper diagnosis. Second, itâs done in a way that youâre minimizing serious risk. The first question always that my wife asks is, âIs the babyâs neck stiff, or do you notice that? â Because thatâs one of the symptoms of meningitis.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"If the mother answers that way, the next point is âIâll meet you at the emergency room. Donât stop. Just goâ. Because it could be something that is fulminant and life-threatening immediately. If itâs not that, then it can go on for an hour.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"But by the way, itâs not just an hour of questions. Itâs an hour of sequenced questions down a decision tree, and itâs fascinating to watch. I wish as economists we had those basic skills inbred. I certainly didnât learn them, and it took me a long time of seeing lots of âpatientsâ to see that one needs that same kind of approach. Thatâs what I mean by differential diagnosis.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Why itâs so annoying to me, the one explanation fits all viewpoints. Because now Iâve seen a lot of places, a lot of crises, a lot of challenges. One of the things that I discovered was how poor our profession is at times in having that sense that the problem that you saw over there is not the same as the problem that youâre seeing here. TYLER COWEN: Let me push on this a bit and see if you can convert me into being more of a Sachsian. One of my worries is that the doctors are not actually in charge.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"It may be the lawyers, which is . . . Weâre in a law school, but still, if I may say, in some ways a step down.

Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"The differential diagnostics may exist in a kind of platonic realm, but you are more optimistic about them than I am. What would you tell me to address my skepticism and make me more of a Sachsian, given that I have this reluctance to embrace your view the way you hold it? JEFFREY SACHS: I think I get what youâre driving at and I do have a fundamental view of at least how I want to proceed professionally. But itâs also based a bit on a theory of change.

Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"JEFFREY SACHS: I believe that knowledge matters and that the more clarity, the more evidence, the more appropriate an analysis, the more likely we can find a good outcome to things. Many people are cynical. I tend not to be. Iâm sometimes accused of being gullible as a result, or being too soft in the face of whatever.

TYLER COWEN: So youâre very optimistic about the power of human reason? JEFFREY SACHS: I believe thatâs where we should put our bets. TYLER COWEN: Thatâs a different claim.

Solvingâmore or less solving the Cuban Missile Crisis, defusing tensions, avoiding nuclear war, right? JEFFREY SACHS: Itâs a book, yes, of this remarkable last year of Kennedyâs life, which included the Cuban Missile Crisis and then negotiating the partial nuclear test ban treaty.

Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"If I could put it in pure conceptual jargon, itâs a story of finding a way to the cooperative outcome of a prisonerâs dilemma. Thatâs, to my mind, a crucial structural feature of our lives, which is that we face constantly this challenge of finding agreement. We face constantly the logic of defection, as itâs called in the prisonerâs dilemma, or the noncooperative outcome thatâs worse for everybody. The question is what to do about that. The cynics say, âWell, the worldâs bound to disagreeâ.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4

Thatâs why, reading the book, it was like a lightbulb went off in my head. JEFFREY SACHS: For me, it also went off in my head as I learned more about this, which is that Kennedy and Khrushchev stumbled into nearly the end of the world in October of 1962, and Kennedy made his share of terrible mistakes.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Our USG, which Iâm usually not too much of a fan of, made its share of terrible mistakes, whether itâs Bay of Pigs or other things. One by one, we stumbledânot to the desire of either of these leadersâto the point where we were within the hairâs breadth of total annihilation. So many stupid things happen in this world, as almost happened again. Some pilot gets lost over Alaska and flies over the Soviet Union, or Russian local commanders in Cuba have the power to fire nuclear weapons. Weâre so close to the edge.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"The Cuban missile crisis is defused I think with real humanity by Kennedy, and by Khrushchev. Then they both basically reached the intuition, âThis is insane, the way weâre acting. This is crazyâ. They find a way to reach an agreement next year. Itâs an agreement in which typically the right on both sides that they face, or the hard-liners, the nationalists on both sides, say, âYou canât agree with each other!",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"â and they find a way to reach an agreement. So to me, it is a paradigm of how we can stay alive in this world and actually get somewhere. TYLER COWEN: If I thought more problems were of an evolutionary nature, had very large numbers of players, didnât have clear channels of communications, didnât have elite advisors, but were more of just a big, messy splat. Should I then be more pessimistic about differential diagnostics? Or do you think that as a model of social change still is going to hold?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"JEFFREY SACHS: For me, the biggest, most complicated mess that weâre in that is like the one youâre describing is climate change. Which in my now 43 years of thinking about economics, so itâs a long time, is the most complicated mess that I can imagine. Itâs got every attribute of just a terrible, terrible problem. Itâs global, itâs long-term, itâs uncertain. Itâs got vested interests, itâs got hugely unequal payoffs, itâs got everything wrong with it as a problem.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4

Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"I would define solving it at this stage as staying below the two-degree Celsius warming which governments have agreed, but not honored, as an upper limit of warming. Iâm taking an approach of how I think I can contribute to that in a very particular way. That way is by helping to define more clearly what that path involves and managing a 15-country project for the UN on defining pathways that satisfy that. To my mind that reflects at least my style of what I believe is the way to do this, which is to say, âWell, what does a solution look like? â It comes back to what [Thomas] Schelling called a focal point for bargaining.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4

There is no one leader that defines the solution. We have to actually agree on something. It seems to me to be a good idea to try to agree on something.

Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"In my opinion, Poland has gone very well. Itâs a great country. Itâs been a success. If I made the following claim, would you agree with it?

Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,True or false? [laughter] JEFFREY SACHS: Iâd say that things I recommended wereâthat was good advice I gave back then. Iâm proud of it. It worked out. It was a very remarkable period of my life and a very remarkable moment and it was exactly one of these periods when youâre just struck at the complexity and the mess and one needed to find a way out of that.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Just to tie that strategy in with how Iâm explaining my general approach, actually, I made recommendations for a significant, rapid change of economic institutions, structure, and politics that had a very big effect in the internal dynamics of what was happening and the international dynamics. But the basic idea of course was not mine at all. The basic idea was in the historical moment, and the basic idea was also Solidarity movementâs idea, and hereâs what I mean. I was asked at one point, âWrite a planâ. It was for me an unbelievable moment which I remember as vividly as anything I remember.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4

So I pulled an all-nighter, and I wrote a plan for transforming Poland from a communist, central-planned economy to a market economy.

Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Russia itself, by virtue of Russia, 11 time zones of the Eurasian land mass, does not have a fixed focal point, and half of Russian history is how weâre a unique civilization, the Third Rome, and half of Russian history is being part of Europe and being part of European civilization. Theyâve never settled that question until now. But the other difference which I foundâ(I didnât understand it then, almost at all, by the way. It took me 20 years to understand it, actually. )âwas how weird it was that in 1989, and this is geopolitics, which I didnât understand as it was happening.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4

JEFFREY SACHS: No, how weird it was in the historical moment that things that had worked extremely well, had shown themselves, where I had had Brent Scowcroft and Bob Dole and others strongly supporting it, all of a sudden just no support from Washington.

Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Whatâs the lesson of this? Quite important, actually. Itâs a little bit off-topic, but very important. We didnât want to help Russia in 1991. We wanted our unipolar world.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4

Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"First of all, Russia faced in 1991 an extremely acute financial crisis. If you havenât lived through a deep, deep, deep financial crisis, itâs hard to understand what it is. Now weâve lived through something mild like that in 2008, which was frightening enough.

Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"This was a macro, macro crisis, and it was a very bad one. The same thing had happened in Poland in a different time dimension, but by 1989, so thatâs why it called for debt cancellation, a standstill on debt payments, an emergency stabilization fund. The first point is financial crisis is in and of itself a distinct category of pathology. Russia had it, China, thank goodness for them, didnât have it. Russia needed help on a financial crisis.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Thatâs number one. By the time they got out of the financial crisis, which was several years later, because we completely stuck it to them in amazing ways and allowed the crisis to be fulminant for a number of years. The reformers were gone, the corruption was completely out of control. I donât want to exonerate the Russians for the irresponsibility and so on and the lack of good strategy.

Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"There are other serious differences, very major differences that are worth just mentioning. We could go into length. But thereâs a big difference of being a urban industrial, broken, Soviet economy. TYLER COWEN: Which was deindustrializing eventually anyway. JEFFREY SACHS: Which had so overgrown the investor heavy industry, and it was in a lot of collapse, versus being an agrarian, impoverished country, as China was in 1978.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"The pathways were bound to be very, very different. The geography is different, by the way, because Chinaâs just filled with people who could do low-cost labor right at the ports on the east coast of China. Whereas for Russia, itâs almost basically a landlocked landmass that was running off of petroleum which had collapsed in global price, which had collapsed in the physical facilities in the countryside, with collapsing steel mills, collapsing everything. It just looked like a waste dump in 1991 when you went around Russia, absolutely cannibalized airplanes at every airport just rusting away, ton after ton of steel rusting away wherever you turned.

Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Youâre an economist. In a very broad sense, youâre representing the profession. A lot of anthropologists criticize what economists do at a pretty broad level. Are you persuaded by what they say, or not?

Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Second, we need an anthropology of economics in the original, literal sense of the word, which is a theory of man much better than we have. We have an 18th-century theory of humanity in a world of 20th-century evolutionary psychology, neuroscience, and a century of psychological understanding. We need a new anthropology in our field. TYLER COWEN: The economy of Mexico, overrated or underrated? JEFFREY SACHS: Itâs probably accurately rated, which is âEh,â really strangely underperforming for a long time, with a lot of difficulty, but 100 million people living in a kind of middle-income stasis and probably really facing the curse of so far from God, so near to the United States.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"The paradox: that somehow the US has created as many problems as itâs created opportunities. It has created a militarized narcotics trafficking and war on drugs, for example, which has been devastating for Mexico in modern times.

Mexico will become number three for auto exports.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Theyâre going to pass South Korea. But you can only squeeze so much more in productivity gains out of the formal sector, and moving from the informal sector to the formal sector for labor is a slow process. It goes on slowly.

Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Would you agree or disagree? JEFFREY SACHS: I donât know. Mexico is a little bit, I would say, just stepping back, a little bit of a mystery for me, why it hasnât done better in development. TYLER COWEN: Letâs talk about Africa. Now you must know Dani Rodrikâs work.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"He and I, maybe you too, heâs worried about premature deindustrialization. That in the old days, countries like the US would have over a quarter of their labor force working in manufacturing with middle-class jobs, often be democratic, and then they would deindustrialize. The new wave of emerging economies, weâre often seeing them deindustrialize at 10 to 15 percent of the workforce being in manufacturing. It may be that service-sector jobs for cultural, economic reasons, some reasons, donât give you the same kind of enduring, increasing returns, ongoing, self-reinforcing economic growth. So when it comes to Africa or other parts of the world, are you worried about premature deindustrialization?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,JEFFREY SACHS: Not very much. TYLER COWEN: Why not? JEFFREY SACHS: I donât think that thereâs any magic to manufacturing. What there is crucially is a need for all developing countries to export. You need to export because you need to import technology.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Manufacturing has been a route to export earnings, to earning a place in the world that allows you to import the technology which 99.9 percent comes from outside your country. The question to ask for Africa is how is it going to pay its way in the world? Not whether itâs going to have manufacturing or not. Thatâs why, by the way, import-substituting manufacturing was no great help for countries that pursued that to an excess. What has worked is export-oriented manufacturing.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Maybe itâll be export-oriented services, mining, agribusiness, and other things. In general if I ask the question, âIs Africa disadvantaged by having to catch up today versus having to catch up 25 years net-net? â Iâd say better off now, because the basic tools for catching up with the information age are stronger now than before. TYLER COWEN: But when you say mining, I worry about your own resource curse. When you say services, India has done this to some extent, as we all know.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"But if you look at Indian service exports, theyâre often done out of a kind of feudal bastion, almost. Companies which build their own roads, their own infrastructure, almost like small private cities. If youâre inside that sphere, it works pretty well for you. But itâs actually a very small segment of the Indian population. That space, they have a head start there.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"If you think what percent of the Nigerian workforce can be employed exporting services . . . Do you think thereâs an argument it could be more than three or 4 percent?

Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"If it werenât for that question, there is no shortage of identifiable jobs that Africa needs for the coming two generations. It needs teachers and it needs doctors and it needs construction workers and it needs engineers and it needs public administration and it needs everything, because itâs coming from poor, rural, overwhelmingly agriculture. Iâm not worried about the job root, but what I am worried about is the balance of payments basically, which is that like any of us, we thrive if we can sell our services somehow. Thatâs true at a country level as it is at an individual level. If you are in an environment where you have nothing to sell, you may have a comparative advantage but if you have nothing to sell, it doesnât matter.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Everybody, every place has a comparative advantage but it doesnât necessarily make you prosperous. I worry very much about places like Chad, Niger, Central African Republic, Mali because theyâre landlocked, they are in incredibly difficult physical geographic conditions, very dry, drying most likely, warming, massive disease burden, most of them with no easy natural resource base, too far from ports to do any kind of assembly operations. Itâs a stepping stone for development. TYLER COWEN: Geography again. JEFFREY SACHS: Just extraordinarily difficult.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Itâs why I also worry about Africaâs demographic trends because obviously I think a lot about the difficulties of development. Youâre mentioning some, but as hard as it is for Africa now with one billion in sub-Saharan Africa, Africaâs going to have two billion people before the middle of the century on the trajectory. Itâs going to have around four billion people on the so-called medium variant fertility trajectory that the UN population division puts forward. I find sustainable development in Africa in those terms not feasible. I couldnât answer that question, what is a viable path.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"When you think about the problems of development in very poor, difficult conditions as much of sub-Saharan Africa has right now, the best thing going forward is this tremendous room for catching up. That means a lot of leapfrogging technologies and the fact that there is a true, phenomenal, wonderful, powerful information revolution underway of which weâre just in the early stages. Weâre still on the first slope of the S-curve in that, and thatâs great. But, there are huge headwinds of which I would say demography and climate change are two, plus the traditional facts for a lot of Africa: disease, very difficult tropical environment, and 14 landlocked countries, all of which make this a very special problem. TYLER COWEN: Let me give you another Dani Rodrik argument.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"He says that once countries get a foothold in manufacturing, their productivity levels converge pretty quickly, but in agriculture itâs much longer. Youâve probably looked at those same numbers. It at least seems true to me. Do you agree with this, and do you think itâs a major problem facing Africa? If so, what should they do about it?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"JEFFREY SACHS: Itâs an example of the ecological context and geography being important. The reason you can get manufacturing convergence of productivity easily is that those are standardized technologies, usually part of international value chains. The specs, equipment, and machinery donât come domestically. They come internationally. The procedures, everything about the production systems, are basically part of an international system.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"When it comes to agriculture, youâre in a completely different world. What counts is your soil, your pests, your climate conditions, your crop varieties locally. Thatâs why technological diffusion in agriculture is much more complex. You cannot simply take, most of the time, something that worked here and plant it here. The double miracle of the Indian Green Revolution was actually two miracles.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"One was that crop yields went up quicklyâbut, second, that they were from seeds from Sonora, Mexico, that Norman Borlaug had taken to India. Lo and behold, after one year of a little bit of experimentation on how to plant them, he and M. S. Swaminathan found that you could use Mexican seeds in the Indian context in the Punjab. The point that Rodrik may be emphasizing here, or finding implicitly, is that technologies diffuse at different rates depending on their capacity for standardization. Manufacturing is typically a very standardized global process. You can make the phones.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"If youâre making the phones, youâre making the same phones whether itâs in Thailand, in China, in Foxconn wherever it is it. Whereas if youâre controlling disease, your disease burdens are different, your ecology is different. If youâre growing food, itâs different. Therefore the context is much more complex.

Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Itâs beautiful. Basically itâs a truism and obvious, but how much of American music is African music? We live on a culture that came from Africa, through the Caribbean, to jazz, to so much. When you watch African music you see so much of the heritage, roots, and improvements of culture and music that you see here. TYLER COWEN: From all countries, whatâs your favorite novel?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,Which novel has influenced you the most? How has it shaped your thinking? How does it play into the other points weâve been discussing?

Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"I am a complete sucker for it. TYLER COWEN: China and Chinese demography, what will happen with China now, and what do they need to do? JEFFREY SACHS: Whatâs happened of fundamental significance for the world is that East Asia has become the third growth pole in the world, or arguably the second, because for the first 200 years of modern economic growth, it was all the North Atlantic. You could call that two regions or one depending on how you want to define it, but it was the US and Europe that defined 90 percent of the technological advance that created the underlying dynamics to which the whole rest of the world would engage in catching up, integration, or falling under imperial rule, or whatever it was. Now, because of the long history of Japanese development, because of the 50-year history of Korean and Taiwanese, Hong Kong, Singapore development, and especially because of the post-1978 scale of Chinaâs achievement, East Asia is an absolutely key, transformative growth pole of the world.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"This, I think, is a fundamental geopolitical, historical, and economic significance. TYLER COWEN: But is China crashing now?

Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Yesterday he wrote about how horrible the UK government has been and how theyâre going to possibly win an election by telling the story that theyâve done a decent job economically. Heâs had a kind of venom for the government. My response, which Iâll publish soon, is called something like âKrugmanâs Anti-Cameron Vitriol,â because it really is vitriolic.

Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"I worked on macroeconomic adjustment programs in dozens of countries for 35 years. I donât buy it.

JEFFREY SACHS: Yeah, and basically, by the way, he did, in my view, two things wrong.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"He misdiagnosed the 2008 crisis, and second, then, gave the prescription to it. The misdiagnosis, in my view, is it was not a Keynesian animal spiritâs crisis, meaning that suddenly there was just a collapse of investment and you needed fiscal stimulus to undo it. It was two things, I would say. If you want to classify it, it was a Hayekian displacement from a credit boom, but even that wasnât enough to lead to a crisis. It was Lehman Brothers failing in September 14, 2008, that drove a financial panic.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Addressing a financial panic is a condition that needs to be addressed as its own pathology. Thatâs my view that if you approached it that wayâbecause I remember arguing with Summers that weekend, and many weekends after thatâapproach it as unlocking the financial panic, not as the need for reaching a $1.6 trillion deficit in 2009. Just get credit going again. In that case, I think, Bernanke, by the way, did the right thing, which was flood the market with liquidity, make extraordinary purchases, QE, all the rest. I thought it was the right policy in 2008 to â09, not the fiscal stimulus, because I didnât think it would work.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"I didnât think it was necessary. I thought it would lead to a big diversion of attention and public investment actually from longer-term things, which in a way is how I would interpret our recent political history.

TYLER COWEN: We have about five minutes left. Iâll give you two questions, and you can divvy up the time for them as you wish. First is to tell us a bit about your new work on ârise of the robotsâ.

Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Very quick on robots, fascinating. Iâm a technophile and a techno-believer. I do believe that we are in a very rapid ascent of information technology. I believe that it is displacing lots of jobs and it is one of the reasons for the low wages, the stagnation of real earnings in the economy because the path of manufacturing employment, which we talked about, has shrunk considerably, chronically. More will come.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4

Are you kidding? We can have the robots do all the work for us,â and I believe thatâs what weâve hoped for ever since leaving Eden when we were condemned to work in the fields 10,000 years ago in the Neolithic Revolution.

Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"If the robots will do it, fantastic. But there is this, actually, deep conceptual question. There is something right, actually, theoretically about the argument that the demand for labor falls, the wages decline, and that can actually lead to a downward spiral in our economies. I have a paper from last year with Larry Kotlikoff showing how that works. I have another paper coming out in a couple of weeks that I really like showing, in an overlapping generations context, how you can get weird outcomes.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"But whatâs always true is that, with enough government intervention, redistribution of various kinds from old to young, for example, from capital owners to labor owners, of course you can make everybody better offâbecause pure technological change by definition, if properly handled, can make everybody better off. This question of how weâre going to handle this transition is a really interesting one. I believe itâs happening. I believe itâs a fascinating subject for analysis and research. I believe itâs not been studied in very much depth yet.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"That leads me to the second question, because it is a good segue. What do we learn in economics? I believe not the right things. Iâll take just this question. In my view, whether itâs the geography questions or the manufacturing question that you asked about or the robotics or whatever it is, whatâs fascinating for us in our real lives and in our societal choices is the change that weâre constantly living in during this past 230 years since Watt gave us the steam engine.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Weâve been in 230 years of relentless change; technological change, structural change, societal change, cultural change.

Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"We avoid that, I think, conceptually, because if you study anything too specific itâs out of date in 10 years. So we study general principles.

We never have good answers when theyâre needed.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Thatâs what I would like us to study. I would like economists to be working with engineers, to be working with public health, to be working with the medical professionals so that weâre actually working on the real systems of our time and adding our pieces to that, understanding and studying that so that we have an answer to robotics, not a pure theoretical model, which is nice and fun, but something that can be helpful.

Those who own the robots, as it were, whether itâs Larry Page and Sergey Brin or others, make a fortune. And those who own the labor that is being substituted see a real decline of their income. Again, conceptually, the idea that machines could do the heavy lifting for us is a good thing for society.

Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Many dry places now, which are often on the descending zone of convective forces like in Hadley cell, become drier with climate change because these convective forces become more powerful. Second, in general, with higher temperatures, evapotranspiration is faster so the soils dry out. All of this means that water crises will intensify. Even without the climate change, water stress is pervasive because population increases and agricultural demands are huge. We have 60,000 major dams in the world diverting runoff already.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"That means famous places like the ROC, which dried out irrespective of the climate change in the past. I can tell you about recent research, and it absolutely comports what I see with my own eyes in many places. Syria had a huge drought, the biggest in its modern history, from 2006 to â10.

Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Donât answer the first right away. A question here, a question there, and then back to Jeff. AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi. Given that a goal of economic development policy is to help low-income countries catch up, what do you believe the Ex-Im Bankâs role, and export subsidies more generally, have in economic development, especially with the knowledge that many of the beneficiaries of Ex-Im assistance are firms in countries with rich economies like Mexico, India, Hong Kong? TYLER COWEN: And the second question?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"AUDIENCE MEMBER: You said that economics should, in a sense, be more humble about its knowledge and economists tend to think that thereâs a certain knowledge of economics that they know, that they have a value-added. Do you see that as justified, that economistsâ economic way of thinking has some value-added? JEFFREY SACHS: I guess the question on Ex-Im Bank, Iâll just make it more general. The big returns to investment in the coming decades, in my view, are largely in the low- and middle-income countries, not surprisingly because their capital is scarce, because they have a big capacity to catch up. They have a big human need also.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"In an idealized world, a tremendous amount of finance would flow from the savings in high-income countries to capital stock in low- and middle-income countries. Of course, some of that happens, for instance, to China or to Mexico in the past. Itâs relatively constrained because there are huge institutional barriers, not the least of which is getting repaid for these loans when theyâre cross-border. Institutions which facilitate that kind of international capital flow can be very good at global improvement. In my view, we have too few of those.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Thatâs why Iâm constantly arguing for both more aid, which are grants, but also more financing through institutions because I think both of these can improve the human condition, make the world safer, help more countries get out of their crises, and so forth. Ex-Im Bank is not my favorite institution, but I think itâs fine. I think it should be improved. There are many specific issues of this financing which Iâm not too keen on.

The second is how markets function.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Both of those provide a wealth of useful knowledge for human betterment, but what economists tend not to do is to get into the details, as it were. We think that the general knowledge is sufficient. That, I think, is a mistake. As Iâve tried to describe in our conversation now, and as Iâve learned in 35 years of work in the field in more than 125 countries, the context is essential because weâre dealing with very complex phenomena.

Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Itâs the complexity of these interacting systems that defines how we need to respond. Weâre not training students that way. Weâre training them in general principles or in very fancy statistical exercises that actually miss the point. Just a final word about that. We have so much statistical machinery to ask the question, âWhat can you learn from this dataset?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"â Thatâs the wrong question because the dataset is always a tiny, tiny fraction of what you can know about the problem that youâre studying. If you want to know about the problem, get out there and learn about it. Donât think that youâre going to find it in your dataset. For that we need a different kind of epistemological approach and a different kind of teaching approach as well. I want our students out on the hospital wards, as it were, but that means being out in the world working and solving problems and dealing with people across many different fields and many different parts of social systems to be able to aggregate to and integrate into meaningful holistic solutions.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4

Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"I donât know where he and Professor Sachs are going to go in their conversation today, but Iâm sure itâs going to be challenging. Itâs going to be interesting. Above all, itâs going to be smart. Again, on behalf of the Mercatus Center, thank you all for joining us today. Please join me in welcoming Tyler Cowen and Jeffrey Sachs.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"[applause] TYLER COWEN: I introduce Jeff Sachs; thatâs easy. Jeff is one of the worldâs best, most famous, and most influential economists. Thereâs more I could say, but letâs start with that. The purpose of these series is to have conversations that you donât find other places on YouTube, and to ask probing questions and have a far-ranging dialogue. What Iâd like to do is kind of overview of Jeffâs career and thought and try and see how it all hangs together, how the different pieces relate to each other.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"What Iâd like to do is start with some of the early pieces, from the â80s and 1990s. Then weâll work our way up to the present. The first question, Jeff, and weâll treat this as a dialogue. Some of your best-cited work has been on the natural resource curse: the idea that economies, when they have natural resourcesâsuch as oilâthat can harm their prospects for growth rather than helping them. Now weâre in 2015.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"How do you see this issue today? Do you think that has changed in any way since the first thesis you wrote? JEFFREY SACHS: First, let me say thank you for having me. Iâm really looking forward to our discussion. About 25 years ago, I started looking more and more at my own work and how economic structure, geography, resource base, and so forth affected development.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Iâve been on a learning curve since then. One of the early works that I engaged in at that point with Andrew Warner and others was looking at this question of how resource wealth, resource dependence one could say, affected development. We found back in the 1990s, looking for the preceding 25 years or so, that the oil-rich countries had grown less rapidly, controlling for seemingly other factors that would be relevant. We started to speculate about that. Thereâs now a huge literature from many different points of view: politics, pure economics, and so forth.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Itâs a pretty rich subject and not so simple to summarize. There really is a resource curse for a lot of resource-rich countries. At this point, looking back, I would put more weight on the political economy aspects probably than the pure, market-driven âDutch diseaseâ aspects which I talked about a quarter century ago. The idea at the time was that if you have resource wealth that pulls you away from more labor-intensive and technology-intensive industries. You donât learn as much.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"You donât develop as much endogenous growth. Now I would say if you have resource wealth, one problem is youâre likely to be invaded. You have more vulnerability to geopolitics as well as to internal politics to mess things up. TYLER COWEN: Is this a habit you can kick or is it path dependence? The price of oil now is quite low.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Do you think those countries that have a lot of oil, now theyâre going to be better off because theyâll be put on this new development path, or is it somehow too late, that theyâre stuck with the bad institutions? JEFFREY SACHS: First, one of the things that Iâve tried to emphasize and that Iâve learned over time is itâs always pretty complicated. There are resource-rich countries that do very well, thank you. There are resource-rich countries that have fallen apart a long time ago and never gotten out of the mess. Any generalization is fraught with problems.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Norway will do well, whether the oil price is high or low. On the other hand, last time the world oil price was persistently low, the Soviet Union collapsed. Russia was near hyperinflation. Different countries under different conditions will adjust to these shocks. Resource-rich Norway, Australia, CanadaâI wouldnât worry too much about them.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Their currencies will weaken. They will find other things to do, whereas some of the very vulnerable countries that have never been able to kick the habit of dependence, like Venezuela, will probably go into a deeper crisis. The Middle East has been in flames now for years. I donât see any easy way out there, either. TYLER COWEN: Hereâs the tension Iâm trying to figure out.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"It relates to a number of issues in your thought. Youâve written some very interesting pieces lately about how the role of institutions is overrated in predicting growth, but institutions seem to play a key role in making the resource theory stick. As you say, Norway has done fine. The US in earlier times did fine with a lot of natural resources. Does thinking about resources lead you back to seeing institutions as important in some new and different way or are you still basically skeptical about institutions mattering at all and wanting to look most of all to geography?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Do you see what Iâm getting at? JEFFREY SACHS: Of course, but again, Iâll say it repeatedly, Iâve never said institutions donât matter. Iâve said institutions arenât the only thing. I find often that people take an idea and carry it to an extreme. This âinstitution mattersâ idea is one of those that Iâve found taken to extremes by causing a kind of geographic blindness, if I could say it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,Geography obviously matters a lot. Resource base matters a lot. Institutions matter a lot. The worldâs complex. Weâre dealing with complex systems.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Itâs not surprising that different things matter at different times and different places. Of course, institutions make a difference. The art of good economics, in my view, is trying to figure out whatâs important, where, when, and in which context. TYLER COWEN: Hereâs a claim youâve made. Itâs very striking.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Itâs one of the most important claims in development economics. Personally, I think itâs true. When you reviewed Acemoglu and Robinson, you said, âIf we go to the year 1960, even knowing who the winners and losers have been, much less forget about forecasting, itâs very hard to come up with a metric of institutions that predicts which countries end up doing well and which countries end up doing poorlyâ. When I read that, I tend to think somehow weâre mismeasuring institutional quality. We really need a better measure of institutions, which we donât have yet.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Institutions will someday matter again, but Iâm looking for this in vain. Where does your thought stand on this now? Do you actually think thereâs some deeper understanding of institutions that will rescue this proposition? When you throw out North Korea and some other crazy countries, institutions donât really have the predictive power for growth. What are your thoughts on this, given that in the across-country regressions, they can do so poorly within the set of semireasonable countries?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"JEFFREY SACHS: Acemoglu and Robinsonâs book Why Nations Fail was one of my least favorite books. I think it is just a bad book, because it takes one thought and tries to drive it as the only explanation of history. Thatâs not a good approach in my view to history, which is a very interesting, complex tableau. They missed one fundamental point right from the start, which is that when you look at development, there are at least two fundamental drivers, not just one. The one that they talk about is innovation, and innovation as being a fundamental driver of growth.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Thereâs a lot of truth to that in the history of the world. But thereâs a second fundamental aspect when we look out in the world and say, âWhoâs doing well? Whoâs doing badly? Why? â and so forth.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Thatâs what is sometimes called âcatching upâ. The phenomenon of catching up is very different from the phenomenon of forging ahead at the front of the technology horizon. When you take that simple distinction, it helps to explain a lot of the post-1960 question that youâre asking. The most successful countries in the world in the last 50 years have been basically the East Asian economies and Southeast Asian economies. Very rarely do they look like the textbook model of Acemoglu and Robinson of the free market economy and so forth.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"In fact, the Peopleâs Republic of China they characterize as justâthatâs an anomaly that is going to collapse in the future so we donât have to explain it now. I think thatâs a huge mistake and a misunderstanding of the basics. Chinaâs in a catching-up mode. The institutions of catching up are quite different from the institutions of being the technology leader, for example. Just understanding that would give them a little more clarity about institutions, per se.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"TYLER COWEN: And corruption, over- or underrated as a driver of growth? JEFFREY SACHS: It depends. Some places are so corrupt you first wouldnât want to step foot in them and Iâve had the experience repeatedly when Iâm talking to a head of state or a finance minister and I watch their eyes glaze over and realize theyâre not interested in what youâre talking about. Theyâre in a different game. Those places can be driven absolutely into the ground by corruption.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Other places have been corrupt for a long timeâIâm thinking of New York, Washington, Lagos, Beijing, and other placesâand you get a lot of economic progress. In that sense, there is no purity in the world. Iâm not a fan of corruption for a lot of reasons that have started with the ethics. TYLER COWEN: Chinaâs massively corrupt and itâs growing at high rates, right? JEFFREY SACHS: China has a lot of corruption.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"The first person to say it is President Xi. The US has a huge amount of corruption and it has done reasonably well over the last 200 years. TYLER COWEN: Let me now ask you a question to challenge the audience, and weâre going to turn to Paul Rosenstein-Rodan, whoâs somewhat of a forgotten figure. But I think still an important figure at George Mason, and maybe for you too. As you know, Rosenstein-Rodan was a development economist.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"He was one of the pioneers of the notion of the big push of an extended move forward on many fronts, all at the same time. But when you look at the early years of his thought, he studied with Mises. He worked with Hayek. He was an Austrian. He was a subjectivist, methodological individualist, and he made some kind of theoretical shift in his mind.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"What is it that you think that Paul Rosenstein-Rodan saw, and presumably you think you see it as well, that the people today who are still Austrians at the theoretical level, what is it that Rosenstein-Rodan saw that allowed him to make that shift or induced him to make that shift at the most basic conceptual level? JEFFREY SACHS: He was writing during and at the end of World War II, when he was saying, âHow are we going to get out of this mess? There are so many pieces that have to be put together. We have to get infrastructure built again. We have to get basic markets operating.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"There are a lot of interconnected pieces, and so weâre going to have to move on a lot of frontsâ. He was facing a historical situation. I would say that his ideaâIâd go back even . . .",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"actually, itâs not back. It was almost contemporaneous with him. Alexander Gerschenkron, who was a very clever economic historian at Harvard. I came as a student just as he was retiring. He was a great mid-century, mid-20th century economic historian.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"He observed that what countries do for development depends on how they stand in relation to the leader, and this is a point I was making earlier, which is that catching up is a fundamental phenomenon in development. Thereâs a difference of growth, which we study as an economy, how does it grow? From the question of catching up, which is a question for a country that is situated with weak technology, weak infrastructure, weak training, and so forth. In the face of advanced economies, what should they do? Now thatâs been a question thatâs been asked for at least 224 years, since Alexander Hamilton sent his letter to the congress on manufacturing in the United States.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Because he said we have to catch up with Britain. Then Friedrich List said, âWe have to catch up with Britainâ. Economic reformers from basically Hamilton on in countries that were lagging behind the lead said, âWhat do we do to catch up? â Now you can carry this too far because the insane version of this, and the unbelievably destructive version of this, was Lenin and Stalin. We have to do anything at no matter what cost of life to catch up, or Mao in the Great Leap Forward, which is insanity and cruelty.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"But, on the other hand, the idea that you do different things to catch up by accelerating the process or by making the big push in a variety of ways has been shown time and again to have a lot of merit. Itâs a balance, once more. The first countries to develop, Britain and the United States . . .",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Take the US. Weâve achieved almost continuous 1.8 percent per year per capita growth for the last 200 years. Not bad, if you do it for 200 years. But if youâre an impoverished country today and you say, âWhatâs our aim? 1.8 percent growth?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"â No, our aim is 10 percent growth, because we really need to catch up. It turned out, because of that catching-up phenomenon, you can make a very, very rapid advance in a way unthinkable for a country in front. But how do you make that advance? Through pure government just stepping back and letting things happen? No.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Through a concerted policy to close gaps. Thatâs the difference. TYLER COWEN: Iâve been reviewing your work, including these books, and a stack of papers here, which is a small fraction of what youâve written. I believe they all have your name on them. What I try to do with thinkers sometimes is boil down what theyâve been writing to the smallest number of dimensions possible.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"If youâll bear with me for a moment, Iâm going to try to do that with you, and then you tell me where Iâm off, or what you would add to that. Reviewing all the things youâve written . . . JEFFREY SACHS: You probably know more about me than I do, so letâs see how it goes.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"[laughter] TYLER COWEN: Maybe. But there are two phrases that strike me again and again. One is when you mention your wife, Sonia, and talk about differential diagnostics. The other is what you call the epoch of the Anthropocene, which you could think of as the time when human beings are in the world in an active way. When we start with primitive society, everything is determined by geography and resources.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Economic development, in a sense, is an ongoing process where human beings impose their will and their reason on the world in a kind of planning or voluntaristic fashion. Then thereâs a belief that first this needs to be done in a differential way. Not the same recipe everywhere. But a belief in the power of human reason to perform these differential diagnostics to turn this era when humans are on the earth into a time when weâre no longer ruled by resources and geography and the prevalence of malaria. But brought into an era where human reason is in some sense running the show.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"If I had to boil down my reread of you into a very short bulletin, thatâs what I would say. Now do you agree with that, how would you change it, and what would you add to that? JEFFREY SACHS: Thatâs pretty good, first of all. I would subscribe to that summary. I should explain this idea of clinical economics, as Iâve called it, or differential diagnosis.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"When youâre married to a pediatrician, as I have been for 35 wonderful years, you get up in the middle of the night a lot when patients call with a very sick child. Iâve listened to my wife take an oral history a thousandâthousands of times, perhaps. Itâs a wonderful art, first of all, because a mother calls with a crisis of a baby or a young childâusually a high fever. The first thing that is important to know is that there are a thousand possible etiologies of that fever. My wife doesnât say institutions.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4

Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"â. No, when it comes to the child, it could be something as normal as a common cold or a something as devastating as meningitis. The purpose of a differential diagnosis is two things. First, it is of course to try to get to the core reasons so that you can make a proper prescription based on a proper diagnosis. Second, itâs done in a way that youâre minimizing serious risk.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"The first question always that my wife asks is, âIs the babyâs neck stiff, or do you notice that? â Because thatâs one of the symptoms of meningitis.

Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"I certainly didnât learn them, and it took me a long time of seeing lots of âpatientsâ to see that one needs that same kind of approach. Thatâs what I mean by differential diagnosis. Why itâs so annoying to me, the one explanation fits all viewpoints. Because now Iâve seen a lot of places, a lot of crises, a lot of challenges. One of the things that I discovered was how poor our profession is at times in having that sense that the problem that you saw over there is not the same as the problem that youâre seeing here.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4

Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Weâre in a law school, but still, if I may say, in some ways a step down. To some extent you have people voting on the baby, not all of whom even know who the baby is or what the babyâs symptoms are. The differential diagnostics may exist in a kind of platonic realm, but you are more optimistic about them than I am. What would you tell me to address my skepticism and make me more of a Sachsian, given that I have this reluctance to embrace your view the way you hold it?

But I believe that thereâs a way to reach an agreement, typically, among pretty conflictual and often pretty antagonistic actors. I tend to believe thereâs a way out of a crisis, and I tend to believe that a lot of what poses as either pure zero-sum struggle or harsh ideological conflict is often resolvable by good, clear ideas, or good, clear evidence, or a good, clear game plan.

Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"It came out last year. Itâs received attention, but less so from economists, for obvious reasons. Itâs a book about leaders sitting down and just doing something and basically getting it right. Is that fair to say? Solvingâmore or less solving the Cuban Missile Crisis, defusing tensions, avoiding nuclear war, right?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"JEFFREY SACHS: Itâs a book, yes, of this remarkable last year of Kennedyâs life, which included the Cuban Missile Crisis and then negotiating the partial nuclear test ban treaty. Basically, I find it a story of tremendous insight and very moving also. If I could put it in pure conceptual jargon, itâs a story of finding a way to the cooperative outcome of a prisonerâs dilemma. Thatâs, to my mind, a crucial structural feature of our lives, which is that we face constantly this challenge of finding agreement. We face constantly the logic of defection, as itâs called in the prisonerâs dilemma, or the noncooperative outcome thatâs worse for everybody.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4

JEFFREY SACHS: For me, it also went off in my head as I learned more about this, which is that Kennedy and Khrushchev stumbled into nearly the end of the world in October of 1962, and Kennedy made his share of terrible mistakes. Our USG, which Iâm usually not too much of a fan of, made its share of terrible mistakes, whether itâs Bay of Pigs or other things. One by one, we stumbledânot to the desire of either of these leadersâto the point where we were within the hairâs breadth of total annihilation. So many stupid things happen in this world, as almost happened again.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4

So to me, it is a paradigm of how we can stay alive in this world and actually get somewhere.

It needs teachers and it needs doctors and it needs construction workers and it needs engineers and it needs public administration and it needs everything, because itâs coming from poor, rural, overwhelmingly agriculture.

Lo and behold, after one year of a little bit of experimentation on how to plant them, he and M. S. Swaminathan found that you could use Mexican seeds in the Indian context in the Punjab.

Now, because of the long history of Japanese development, because of the 50-year history of Korean and Taiwanese, Hong Kong, Singapore development, and especially because of the post-1978 scale of Chinaâs achievement, East Asia is an absolutely key, transformative growth pole of the world.

Thatâs my view that if you approached it that wayâbecause I remember arguing with Summers that weekend, and many weekends after thatâapproach it as unlocking the financial panic, not as the need for reaching a $1.6 trillion deficit in 2009.

Many dry places now, which are often on the descending zone of convective forces like in Hadley cell, become drier with climate change because these convective forces become more powerful.

Itâs the complexity of these interacting systems that defines how we need to respond. Weâre not training students that way. Weâre training them in general principles or in very fancy statistical exercises that actually miss the point.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4
Jeffrey Sachs (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Just a final word about that. We have so much statistical machinery to ask the question, âWhat can you learn from this dataset? â Thatâs the wrong question because the dataset is always a tiny, tiny fraction of what you can know about the problem that youâre studying. If you want to know about the problem, get out there and learn about it. Donât think that youâre going to find it in your dataset.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4

Dani Rodrik (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"The notion that a mix of automation and competitive trade with wealthier nations might mean that poorer nations today will not be able to industrialize and follow the path of South Korea or Taiwan or Singapore. Now, if this is the case, if a lot of economies out there are deindustrializing prematurely, before theyâve built up a significant middle class, what do you see happening, for instance, for the future of Africa? The parts of Africa which do relatively well, but letâs say they do not industrialize. What does that future look like in your vision? DANI RODRIK: I donât think it means that there is a very bleak future for the countries of sub-Saharan Africa.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M17H2dZixEI
Dani Rodrik (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"I just think that is going to be very difficult, if not impossible, for them to replicate the very rapid convergence experience of East and Southeast Asian countries. If you look throughout economic history, the countries that have made that very rapid leap into middle income and beyond that advanced country status, starting from the non-Western countries first, Japan from the late 19th century onward, and then after the Second World War, South Korea, Taiwan, and then eventually, of course, China, along with a number of countries that did more or less the same in the periphery of Western Europe, closer to Western Europe. The one thing thatâs common in all of them is very rapid industrialization. With very rapid industrialization, you can get growth rates on a per capita basis of 4 or 5 percent per year on an ongoing basis for decade after decade. Thatâs sort of whatâs made South Korea what it is today, in that kind of rapid growth.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M17H2dZixEI
Dani Rodrik (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"But thatâs, if you will, a very exceptional kind of experience. I think if the possibilities of rapid industrialization are no longer thereâââas you suggest, I think they are no longer thereâââwhat weâre going to get is slower growth. What I call growth is based much more on the steady and hard work of accumulating basic capabilities, human capital, skills, institutional improvement. All of those things that are required for the long run, but donât produce the kind of 4 percent, 5 percent growth on a per annum basis, as weâve seen in those rapid growth countries.

Dani Rodrik (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"South Korea has done very well exporting, and that created for them a set of interest groups which were willing to fund that infrastructure, bring the whole country together so to speak. You end up with a middle class being built rapidly. That middle class is the foundation for a democracy. The special interest groups behind the infrastructure, itâs clear who they are. They win almost every political battle, even without a democracy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M17H2dZixEI
Dani Rodrik (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"You see some version of the same in China. The countries that donât industrialize, could you imagine them having an ongoing kind of ramshackle existence where consumer goods flood in at cheap prices? They grow at 4 percent instead of 10 percent. But Lagos, in a way, always looks a bit like current Lagos and never looks like Seoul, South Korea.

Dani Rodrik (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"RODRIK: I think what matters here is probably less the quantitative side, how rapidly youâre growing, but the qualitative things that are happening during the growth process. You have to bear in mind that there are archetypal, successful industrialization growth, liberal democracy kind of countries in fact, never experienced the kind of growth rate that Japan and South Korea or China did. In the aftermath of the Industrial Revolution, Great Britain was growing at rates that we would scoff at today for any emerging market. So, it wasnât the growth itself that enabled the development of the middle class and the emergence and the spread of liberal values and the creating of the liberal democracy, but the transformation of the economy and its social structure in a particular kind of way. If you will, the spread of bourgeois liberal values, the restraints placed on the state in terms of how much it could do and under what kind of circumstances.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M17H2dZixEI

If you will, the spread of bourgeois liberal values, the restraints placed on the state in terms of how much it could do and under what kind of circumstances. Youâre right that in countries like Nigeria and many others, which have had very rapid population growth, where the urban areas have swollen with people from the countryside. I think managing these kinds of tensions, especially when youâre in a sort of open economy and the markets are being flooded by cheap consumer goods from elsewhere, managing these transitions are very difficult, especially since these countries, and Africa, of course, particularly so, are torn apart by a number of additional cleavages of ethnic, language, regional, tribal, and so forth.

Dani Rodrik (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Iâm not so sure that rapid growth would necessarily have eliminated these kinds of problems. In some ways, it might even aggravate them. Think, for example, that in the Arab Spring, the kind of troubles and the riots that started the Arab Spring, arose not in those parts of the Arab world which had had the least amount of development but, in fact, in those countries like Tunisia and Egypt which had had the most rapid development.

As I understand you, if you do industrial policy and you get the right kind of manufacturing that puts you on a better path.

Dani Rodrik (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Catch-up in agriculture is especially slow. I find this intuitively plausible but if we try to ask at the most foundational level, what is it exactly thatâs the difference between agriculture and manufacturing which accounts for this? What are the microfoundations of where that comes from? RODRIK: I think a couple of things. One is that manufacturing technology is much more easily transportable across international borders.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M17H2dZixEI
Dani Rodrik (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Itâs much easier to adopt and adapt manufacturing technology. You can take a textile and clothing plant. You still have to tinker with it, but itâs much easier to transplant, unlike many agricultural technologies. Weâve seen that, for example, in the case of the Green Revolution. It required a lot of on-the-ground adaptation because the weather and soil conditions can be very different.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M17H2dZixEI
Dani Rodrik (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"If you will, the non-traded component of that technology transfer is much greater in agriculture. For that matter, itâs also in services. You can figure out how to run a hospital system or education system in an advanced country. Youâre never going to be able to just take that and transplant in a developing country because, technically speaking, the non-traded component of that technology, or the latent part of the technology that requires that adaptation to local contexts.

One thing I said is that itâs much easier to move technology.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M17H2dZixEI
Dani Rodrik (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"If youâve seen the way that Toyota manufactures cars in Japan or in the United States or in South Africa, itâs more or less the same. That is possible. The second thing, which I think is the microeconomics of why it is that manufacturing is so special is that manufacturing, standard, traditional manufacturing like making cars or garments or toys or wigs, has the feature that you can absorb a lot of very unskilled workers into that. Being a production worker, even in an auto factory, certainly in a footwear factory, doesnât take a whole lot of skill. That means that you can absorb a lot of people off the countryside in a much more rapid way than you could in a lot of other activities where technology and skill are actually highly complementary.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M17H2dZixEI
Dani Rodrik (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"I heard once a Chinese entrepreneur telling me that she was running a footwear factory and she was hiring people from the countryside when the industry was starting. Basically, the only skill that was required to get that thing going was not whether they could read, not whether they were numerate, but basically whether they could do this with their hands. Basic eye-hand coordination is all the skill that was required. You could put thousands of people into these factories. The fact that you can absorb a lot of people, you can increase their productivity threefold, fourfold off the farm by putting them in these factories is an opportunity that very few other economic sectors provide.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M17H2dZixEI
Dani Rodrik (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"A third, and Iâll just mention it. A third thing, which is very important in manufacturing, is tradable. You donât have to develop a whole industrial complex. You can import inputs and then export the outputs. You donât require domestic demand to take off.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M17H2dZixEI
Dani Rodrik (full) | Conversations with Tyler,You donât require an economy-wide productivity revolution in order to have consumers to whom you can sell your output. You can simply sell it on world markets. What that means is that itâs enough to develop mastery in one segment of manufacturing at a time. That provides the kind of engine that you need. Compare that with the kind of transformation you need in services where most of the output has to be sold domestically.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M17H2dZixEI
Dani Rodrik (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"You need basically everybodyâs incomes to grow, every sector to experience a productivity increase so you have a large enough market that you can sell. Otherwise, any service sector that is doing really well eventually is going to experience very rapid terms of trade deterioration domestically. Those things, the transferability of the technology, the fact that it can absorb a lot of unskilled workersâââtraditionally, this is whatâs changingâââoff the countryside, or out of informality and tradability I think is what makes manufacturing, historically has made it special.

Dani Rodrik (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"But take the case now, thereâs premature deindustrialization going on in many countries. It might be hard to reverse.

Now, the supply chains are all around the globe.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M17H2dZixEI
Dani Rodrik (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"In a time like this, where manufacturing is changing rapidly and policy itself is subject to a status quo bias, as we know from your own writings, what do you think is the new role for industrial policy, if any? Should we today, perhaps, not be more skeptical about it than we were, say, when Singapore started it? RODRIK: I think the answer to your last question is yes, although I wouldnât say we should be more skeptical. I think we should expect lower return to it, is what I like to say, simply because I think the possibilities of industrialization in the sense that you could put, in the old days, 30, 35 percent of your labor force into manufacturingâââthat is not going to happen. Sub-Saharan Africa will not get there.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M17H2dZixEI
Dani Rodrik (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"What that means is that the returns to even successful industrial policy these days are less. That has a couple of implications. One is that, increasingly, I think we really need a different term. We shouldnât say industrial policy. Maybe we should talk about a structural transformation policy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M17H2dZixEI
Dani Rodrik (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Your perspective in terms of how do you get to rapid transformation. You should move away a little bit at the margin from manufacturing into other parts of the economy. I think you should be thinking more about services, as well. A lot of services are tradable. To some extent, some of the advantages might exist in tradable services, as well.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M17H2dZixEI
Dani Rodrik (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"The other thing which I think a lot ofÂ . . . a common mistake in industrial policy that low- and middle-income countries do, which is to look at industrial policy or criteria for success of industrial policy in terms of output, exports, innovation, R&D, patents, and things like that.

Dani Rodrik (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"The question is, are you generating adequate employment in these more productive industries that are oriented into world markets? Because the kind of industrial policy that ends up generating profits and investment and R&D in a low-to-middle-income country, but at the same time your employment is shrinking, is not going to be the kind of high-return activity for the economy as a whole. I think youâre basically right. I go around these days a lot less advocating for very forceful industrial policy, in large part because I do think that the returns to it have fallen. I think also we need to think through a lot more what it should look like in a world where in fact we are concerned at least as much about services as manufacturing, even in the middle-income or low-income countries.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M17H2dZixEI

That means losing the monetary integration in particular. Now, you ask me which would be my preference.

If they werenât losing some reserves, thatâs part of the optimal adjustment. If you ask me, âTell me why I should be worried about China?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M17H2dZixEI
Dani Rodrik (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"â I can give you real reasons why you should be worrying about China relating to the fact that they in fact have both a huge political transformation ahead of them, as well as a huge economic transformation. The political transformation being the one of having to open up eventually, become more democratic, and we have no idea how they will manage that. The economic transformation, which they have not really gotten underway seriouslyâââtheyâve started, but itâs really, they are at the very beginningâââitâs hard to turn into more of a domestically consumer-oriented, less investing, more consuming kind of economy, and less dependent on the world market. Those are hugely challenging problems. Managing the currency right now, and the financials.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M17H2dZixEI
Dani Rodrik (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Thereâs the stock market, which is a tiny, tiny part of the Chinese economy. It pales, I think, in comparison to those bigger issues. COWEN: Letâs take Milton Friedmanâs dilemma, which is in a way an early version of Rodrikâs trilemma. Friedman argued there was a natural tension between high levels of immigration and the welfare state. You see this quite sharply now in Western Europe.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M17H2dZixEI
Dani Rodrik (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"In some ways, you see it in the United States, even though our immigration has not been up lately. But the tension is there. If politically it turned out that you had to choose at the margin, cutting back immigration or cutting back the welfare state, you as a citizen, the economist cannot say. But what are your thoughts on that? RODRIK: I start from the supposition that borders matter.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M17H2dZixEI
Dani Rodrik (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Borders have moral significance. I accept the notion that letâs say we as a democracy or our citizens donât necessarily put the same weight on somebody on the other side of the border as they do somebody whoâs their neighbor or share the same political system.

Which is that we can allow some people to come in, and those who are coming in are going to be better off, potentially at the cost of some of my own conationals being worse off. My answer is that, at the margin, this is a relatively easy question to answer. Because I say, âOK, how much weight would I have to place on somebody on the other side of the border, relative to somebody on my side of the border, for me not to let that person in? â If you do the calculation, which I have done recently, which is to sayÂ .",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M17H2dZixEI

Iâm asking the question, under what kind of weighting of outsiders would it be a bad idea for me not to let some more people to come in?

Dani Rodrik (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Then I say, look, I might understand that itâs reasonable to say, âOK, maybe I care twice as much as somebody whoâs my neighbor as somebody whoâs not,â but five times as much? Iâm not so sure. That seems excessive. Given how restrictive and how high these barriers are at the moment, at the margin, to me itâs a relatively easy answer.

To put it in a somewhat, to draw an analogy between the trade regime, what has happened in terms of trade liberalization and the migration regime, the migration regime today is more or less where the trade regime was back in the 1950s. Back in the 1950s, the global gains from further liberalizing of trade relative to the income distributional costs within countries and so forth was relatively huge. * I think the migration regime is somehow back there.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M17H2dZixEI

Dani Rodrik (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"I have so many questions about Turkey to ask you, but let me just try two or three. Letâs take the Turkish city of Konya. Iâve been to Konya. Outsiders sometimes call Konya the bible belt of Turkey. Iâm not sure thatâs a good comparison, but itâs a more religious city than Istanbul.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M17H2dZixEI
Dani Rodrik (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Itâs a kind of heartland city in Turkey. Just a little simple question. I would put it this way. Do you trust the median voter in Konya? If you think about Turkeyâs troubles, if Turkey were truly ruled by the median voter in Konya, to what extent would things be fine, or to what extent is the problem itâs not really democratic enough?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M17H2dZixEI
Dani Rodrik (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Do you see what Iâm asking? Because in some obvious ways, the current regime is not very democratic, even though there are elections of a sort. But do you trust the median voter in Konya? RODRIK: I do trust the median voter in Konya, as I would trust the median voter in any country. However, I think when you think about democracy, itâs not just about the median voter.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M17H2dZixEI
Dani Rodrik (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"I think, and this is why Iâm working on this topic, on the question of liberal democracy. The things about democracy that we really care about are just two-fold. One is that we want the median voterâs views to be reflected. The second is we donât want to allow the median voter to do whatever he or she wants to the rest of the population. Thatâs why I think the constraints that liberalism or liberal institutions, the rule of law, the constraints of non-discrimination of minorities of ideological or ethnic or religious sort.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M17H2dZixEI
Dani Rodrik (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Those are equally important parts of well-functioning democracies. One thing that has happened in countries like Turkey, which is actually a very widespread phenomenon around the world, is as the franchise and elections have spread around the world, by the count of the Polity, which is this group that keeps track of this, we have now more democracies than autocracies in the world. But theyâre all electoral democracies. Theyâre democracies precisely in the sense that you meant, which is that you have elections regularly theyâre generally free and fair. But what they do, however, is that they allow the winners of those elections to more or less freely trample on the rights of those who are not part of that winning majority.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M17H2dZixEI
Dani Rodrik (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"So the liberal element of that democracy is really whatâs missing. Iâm all for empowering the median voter in Turkey or elsewhere, but all in the context of rules and practices that ensure equal treatment of minorities of all kind. Thatâs really the part that I think, for example, the whole political economy literature on democracy has missed out on, because essentially itâs just thinking about it in terms of elections and the median voter, not thinking about it in terms of these restraints on what the median voter can do. COWEN: Thinking in terms of minorities, if we go to the Eastern Mediterranean in times past, todayâs Ä°zmir was once Smyrna. It was a fantastically cosmopolitan city.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M17H2dZixEI
Dani Rodrik (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Greeks, Armenians, people from all over the Middle East, Westerners lived there. It was for quite a while in harmony.

In the early part of the 20th century, that changes very fundamentally.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M17H2dZixEI
Dani Rodrik (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"You have some very violent events, and itâs never gone back. Do you think itâs possible for the Eastern Mediterranean to be an area where these civil minorities have protection, or do you think the more monoglot version, Turks plus Kurds, now plus refugees, is simply what weâre going to have? How do you think about that whole change? A great, terrible, unfortunate development, or somehow, itâs a bit like the European 17th century. Great human tragedy, but a clearing out that enabled nation-states to in some way move forward?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M17H2dZixEI
Dani Rodrik (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"RODRIK: The big change, of course, was nationalism and the creation of the nation-state. I donât think that the old order was a particularly desirable one. It is one that of course significantly circumscribed what the Greeks or the Armenians or the Jews or the other minorities were allowed to do in these multinational empires. Itâs not like this wonderful Ancien RÃ©gime that we canât resuscitate. Of course, the forces of nationalism and the creation of the nation-state moved us into this new world where I think what happened in the Eastern Mediterranean as in so many other parts of the world was that you had mobilization of the masses under a nationalist rubric relatively early in terms of historical development compared to Western European countries.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M17H2dZixEI
Dani Rodrik (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"For example, in Western Europe you had liberal ideas developed before the franchise became a mass franchise. In fact in Britain and Western Europe, the liberals didnât wantâââliberalism existed before democracy came into being. Whereas, of course, in the Eastern Mediterranean and places like Turkey weâre trying to create liberalism, after you had a nationalist mobilization and the creation of democratic-like regimes based on the mass franchise. Itâs harder to bring those ideas of tolerance, the separation of powers, the rule of law and so forth relatively later in the game. Thatâs whatâs happening.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M17H2dZixEI
Dani Rodrik (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"But it is not impossible. One of the places that I like to talk about, in fact I talk about this in my latest paper on liberal democracy, is the case of Lebanon in the Eastern Mediterranean. Lebanon until 1975 was a fascinating example ofâââit wasnât exactly a liberal democracy because it was based on these different groups. They each had their shares in power and constitutionally they were each allocatedÂ . .",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M17H2dZixEI
Dani Rodrik (full) | Conversations with Tyler,". [crosstalk] RODRIK: But it was, political scientists writing about Lebanon in the â60s and â70s talked about it as a liberal democracy. The reason was because you had so many different groups, so many cross-cutting cleavages. You had the Muslims and Christians, the Christians were between the Greek Orthodox and the Muslims were between the Shia and the Sunni. There were so many of these cross-cutting cleavages that they essentially had reached a modus operandi that no individual group had this notion that if simply they could prevail, then they could rule forever.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M17H2dZixEI
Dani Rodrik (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"When you donât have that expectation, then you work out bargains with alternatives. Because you are afraid of what the other side is going to do to you when they come to power, if they have a chance of doing that. Of course, how that system came to an end is also interesting, because once you had the massive influx of Palestinian refugees from Jordan, that balance was upset. You now have one group that can, has potentially, can see itself as having a majority for an indefinite period time, so no longer has to essentially keep on with that basic compromise. Thatâs how the Lebanese consociational system came to an end after 1975 with the civil war.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M17H2dZixEI

I donât think this has anything to do necessarily with Islam. Itâs not in the water. These things can happen.

Dani Rodrik (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"So that you have this, if you will, these repeated game incentives to basically not discriminate against those not in power very much. I can certainly come up with scenarios for Turkey where this might have developed over time. I would have to blame successive mistakes made by political leaderships at different times as to why this process has so often been short-circuited. First, of course, the military by intervening repeatedly and, therefore, short-circuiting this process of building up these habits of regular change in power and therefore moderation and compromise developing.

There was a time, when I came out of graduate school, if you were doing development economics and you were doing something empirical, you could never get a job. Probably in development economics at the time, you couldnât get a job period. But the point was, doing empirical economics would not make you sort of rise up. I think that was terrible, and I weâve now basically moved all the way to the other extreme, where empirical work also means doing something where you put 100 percent weight on internal validity, but very little thought into issues of external validity or the basic theory.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M17H2dZixEI

You had India and China and the Ottoman Empire, all these nascent textile industries being decimated by imports from Britain. But, of course, we also have cases like Japan, which in the late 19th century, despite having very low tariffs, being able to develop its own domestic industry. We have at least one exception, even back then, of a country that could industrialize despite those circumstances. The late 20th and 21st century analogue of that imperialism, if you will, is China because itâs been China that has been essentially swamping the world with manufactured goods.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M17H2dZixEI
Dani Rodrik (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"You go to a country like Ethiopia today in Africa and basically everything is imported from China. Fifty years ago, a country like Ethiopia would be manufacturing very simple things, from footwear to tables and chairs to cardboard boxes. But now, everything is coming from China. The fact that we moved to a stage of the world where a country like China is able to exert such strong effect on world markets in manufacturing means that the opportunities for import substitution in manufacturing is significantly less today in the low income countries that have opened themselves up. Itâs not, obviously, imperialism but itâs sort of like, if you will, the imperialism of free trade might be one way of putting it for our current experience.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M17H2dZixEI
Dani Rodrik (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Thatâs clearly one. Itâs also, in terms of the fact that earlier I was saying that traditionally manufacturing has had the ability to absorb a lot of unskilled labor. Manufacturing has become more and more capital-intensive over time. That means that now even garments or textiles, footwear, theyâve become fairly skill-intensive activities.

Dani Rodrik (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"I have no idea for that question. I have no inside knowledge of that to share. I think the question you were asking is extending the notion that more crosscutting cleavages imply greater political stability and tolerance and moderation. Can we take that idea to the international sphere, in particular apply it to nuclear proliferation? If more states have nuclear weapons, would that make the world safer?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M17H2dZixEI
Dani Rodrik (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Iâm not quite sure about the analogy, the way that youâve taken that idea and extended it to the global sphere because the notion of crosscutting cleavages has to do with when youâre operating not in a state of anarchy, so to speak, but when youâre operating in a well-ordered polity. Iâm not sure that that analogy carries to what is effectively the state of anarchy at the global level, where there is no global government so the nature of competition is very different. The idea of nuclear proliferation globally greatly worries me. Not because I think that the marginal country is going to be less responsible than the countries that already have nuclear weapons, but just because the more countries that have them, the greater the chance that at least one of them will be irresponsible rises. I think just probabilistically that makes me very, very nervous.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M17H2dZixEI

Whatâs happening in Turkey? Whatâs happening in Turkey is that the extent of corruption and crony capitalism, the part of it that we have already seen, is vastly superior than anything that has come out in Brazil.

Dani Rodrik (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"Itâs the kind of thing that Dilma could be guilty of pales in comparison. The fact that anything in Turkey, in terms of trying to delete the judiciary when it went into trying to clean this system up, it did it in a way that was explicitly politically motivated. Therefore, it made it much easier for ErdoÄan to clamp down on it because it was clear that it was a politically motivated attack on him, which makes neither side really right. This essentially means that in a country like Turkey, basically youâre postponing all these problems into the future.

Dani Rodrik (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"The notion of a best practice is based on the idea that you can simply just have something that worked somewhere and take it and copy it and apply it somewhere else. Not only does that not work in general, it gives us a very lazy frame of mind. We end up developing all these World Economic Forum scorecards where we have all these checklists of the business environment rankings, or even the sustainable development goals. I think to some extent, these things can be important as public relations, as PR for it.

Dani Rodrik (full) | Conversations with Tyler,"The returns to any export-oriented strategy are also lower now. We havenât talked about this but I think thereâs a sense in which the world economy isnât going to be as much of an engine for growth for developing and emerging markets in the future as it has been until now. As will manufacturing industry will not be that. I donât see this trade off between fundamentals versus a more proactive government policy thatâs trying to generate new industries, not just manufacturing but also services. What I always look for is a very pragmatic kind of attitude towards the private sector and the business sector, which is a government thatâs sort of saying, âWhat is it that we can do to unlock possibilities?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M17H2dZixEI

It doesnât mean youâre going to be picking winners but it does mean that youâre going to be willing to get activity started that might not have started otherwise. Some of them will fail.
